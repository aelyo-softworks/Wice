/// This function is commonly used to add a subtle anticipation effect to animations.
/// The implementation is:
/// <code>
/// f(t) = t^3 - t * A * sin(πt)
/// </code>
/// where <c>t</c> is <paramref name="normalizedTime"/> and <c>A</c> is <see cref="Amplitude"/>.

/// for certain amplitude values by design.
