0071: 
0072: St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.
0073: 
0074: 
0075: You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
0076: commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
0077: forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
0078: my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
0079: of my undertaking.
0080: 
0081: I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
0082: Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
0083: braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
0084: feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
0085: which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
0086: Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
0087: and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
0088: frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
0089: region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
0090: visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
0091: perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put
0092: some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;
0093: and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
0094: wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
0095: globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the
0096: phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
0097: solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
0098: may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
0099: regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
0100: voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I
0101: shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
0102: never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
0103: the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
0104: conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
0105: laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
0106: boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
0107: native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
0108: cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
0109: mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
0110: to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
0111: requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
0112: all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
0113: 
0114: These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
0115: letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
0116: to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
0117: a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
0118: eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
0119: have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
0120: been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
0121: through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a
0122: history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
0123: whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,
0124: yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study
0125: day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
0126: I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction
0127: had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
0128: 
0129: These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
0130: whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also
0131: became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
0132: I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
0133: names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well
0134: acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
0135: But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
0136: thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
0137: 
0138: Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I
0139: can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this
0140: great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I
0141: accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;
0142: I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often
0143: worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
0144: nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
0145: branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
0146: the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an
0147: under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I
0148: must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
0149: dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
0150: earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.
0151: 
0152: And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
0153: My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
0154: every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging
0155: voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is
0156: firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am
0157: about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
0158: will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits
0159: of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.
0160: 
0161: This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
0162: quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
0163: my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The
0164: cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have
0165: already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
0166: deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
0167: prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no
0168: ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and
0169: Archangel.
0170: 
0171: I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
0172: intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
0173: insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary
0174: among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to
0175: sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how
0176: can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
0177: will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,
0178: or never.
0179: 
0180: Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,
0181: and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
0182: love and kindness.
0183: 
0184: Your affectionate brother,
0185: 
0186: R. Walton
0187:

0190: 
0191: Letter 2
0192: 
0193: _To Mrs. Saville, England._
0194: 
0195: Archangel, 28th March, 17—.
0196: 
0197: 
0198: How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
0199: Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a
0200: vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have
0201: already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly
0202: possessed of dauntless courage.
0203: 
0204: But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
0205: absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no
0206: friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
0207: will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no
0208: one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts
0209: to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
0210: feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
0211: eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I
0212: bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
0213: courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
0214: tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a
0215: friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution
0216: and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me
0217: that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
0218: on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.
0219: At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
0220: country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
0221: most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the
0222: necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
0223: country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
0224: schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my
0225: daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters
0226: call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense
0227: enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
0228: endeavour to regulate my mind.
0229: 
0230: Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the
0231: wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet
0232: some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
0233: rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
0234: and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
0235: more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an
0236: Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,
0237: unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
0238: humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
0239: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist
0240: in my enterprise.
0241: 
0242: The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
0243: ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
0244: circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
0245: me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years
0246: spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
0247: groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to
0248: the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
0249: necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
0250: of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
0251: myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
0252: of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
0253: happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved
0254: a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
0255: sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw
0256: his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
0257: tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
0258: confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
0259: and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend
0260: reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
0261: instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his
0262: money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
0263: bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
0264: prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
0265: woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
0266: man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
0267: when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
0268: until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
0269: inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is
0270: so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind
0271: of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
0272: the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
0273: otherwise he would command.
0274: 
0275: Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can
0276: conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am
0277: wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
0278: is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The
0279: winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
0280: is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail
0281: sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me
0282: sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
0283: safety of others is committed to my care.
0284: 
0285: I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
0286: undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
0287: the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
0288: I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the
0289: land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
0290: be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and
0291: woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I
0292: will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my
0293: passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
0294: production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something
0295: at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically
0296: industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
0297: labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
0298: in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
0299: of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
0300: regions I am about to explore.
0301: 
0302: But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after
0303: having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of
0304: Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to
0305: look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to
0306: me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when
0307: I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. 
0308: Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.
0309: 
0310: Your affectionate brother,
0311:  Robert Walton

0316: Letter 3
0317: 
0318: _To Mrs. Saville, England._
0319: 
0320: July 7th, 17—.
0321: 
0322: 
0323: My dear Sister,
0324: 
0325: I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced
0326: on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on
0327: its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not
0328: see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good
0329: spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
0330: floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
0331: of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We
0332: have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
0333: summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,
0334: which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire
0335: to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
0336: expected.
0337: 
0338: No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
0339: letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
0340: accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
0341: I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
0342: 
0343: Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as
0344: yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,
0345: persevering, and prudent.
0346: 
0347: But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I
0348: have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
0349: themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not
0350: still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the
0351: determined heart and resolved will of man?
0352: 
0353: My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must
0354: finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!
0355: 
0356: R.W.
0357: 
0358: 
0359: 
0360: 
0361: Letter 4
0362: 
0363: 
0364: _To Mrs. Saville, England._
0365: 
0366: August 5th, 17—.
0367: 
0368: So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
0369: recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
0370: these papers can come into your possession.
0371: 
0372: Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
0373: in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
0374: she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
0375: were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,
0376: hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
0377: 
0378: About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
0379: in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
0380: have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
0381: grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
0382: attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
0383: situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
0384: dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
0385: being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
0386: sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress
0387: of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
0388: distant inequalities of the ice.
0389: 
0390: This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,
0391: many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
0392: it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
0393: ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
0394: greatest attention.
0395: 
0396: About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
0397: night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the
0398: morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
0399: float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to
0400: rest for a few hours.
0401: 
0402: In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
0403: found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
0404: talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
0405: had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
0406: fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
0407: being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
0408: He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
0409: some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the
0410: master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
0411: on the open sea.”
0412: 
0413: On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
0414: foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,
0415: “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”
0416: 
0417: You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
0418: to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
0419: supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
0420: have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I
0421: replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
0422: northern pole.
0423: 
0424: Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
0425: Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
0426: his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were
0427: nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
0428: suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted
0429: to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
0430: air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and
0431: restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
0432: swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we
0433: wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
0434: kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
0435: which restored him wonderfully.
0436: 
0437: Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
0438: feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he
0439: had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and
0440: attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more
0441: interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of
0442: wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
0443: performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
0444: trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
0445: a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he
0446: is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
0447: teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
0448: 
0449: When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off
0450: the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
0451: allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
0452: and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
0453: Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
0454: in so strange a vehicle.
0455: 
0456: His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
0457: he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”
0458: 
0459: “And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”
0460: 
0461: “Yes.”
0462: 
0463: “Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
0464: saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”
0465: 
0466: This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of
0467: questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
0468: pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,
0469: doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
0470: people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”
0471: 
0472: “Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
0473: trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”
0474: 
0475: “And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
0476: benevolently restored me to life.”
0477: 
0478: Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the
0479: ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer
0480: with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
0481: midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
0482: before that time; but of this I could not judge.
0483: 
0484: From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the
0485: stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
0486: the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in
0487: the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
0488: I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant
0489: notice if any new object should appear in sight.
0490: 
0491: Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
0492: present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
0493: silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
0494: Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
0495: interested in him, although they have had very little communication
0496: with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
0497: constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must
0498: have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
0499: so attractive and amiable.
0500: 
0501: I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend
0502: on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been
0503: broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
0504: of my heart.
0505: 
0506: I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
0507: should I have any fresh incidents to record.
0508: 
0509: 
0510: 
0511: 
0512: August 13th, 17—.
0513: 
0514: 
0515: My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my
0516: admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so
0517: noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
0518: grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
0519: when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
0520: yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
0521: 
0522: He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,
0523: apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
0524: unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he
0525: interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently
0526: conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without
0527: disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
0528: eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken
0529: to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the
0530: language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul
0531: and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would
0532: sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my
0533: enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for
0534: the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should
0535: acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a
0536: dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I
0537: perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
0538: his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle
0539: fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I
0540: paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you
0541: share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;
0542: let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”
0543: 
0544: Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
0545: paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
0546: powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
0547: necessary to restore his composure.
0548: 
0549: Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise
0550: himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of
0551: despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked
0552: me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it
0553: awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a
0554: friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than
0555: had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
0556: boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
0557: 
0558: “I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are
0559: unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
0560: ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to
0561: perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most
0562: noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
0563: friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
0564: despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life
0565: anew.”
0566: 
0567: As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
0568: grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently
0569: retired to his cabin.
0570: 
0571: Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
0572: does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight
0573: afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
0574: elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he
0575: may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
0576: has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
0577: halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
0578: 
0579: Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine
0580: wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and
0581: refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
0582: somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
0583: appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I
0584: have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
0585: elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I
0586: believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
0587: power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
0588: for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
0589: voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.
0590: 
0591: 
0592: 
0593: 
0594: August 19th, 17—.
0595: 
0596: 
0597: Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain
0598: Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
0599: determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
0600: me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for
0601: knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
0602: gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
0603: has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
0604: useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
0605: course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
0606: what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
0607: that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
0608: in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
0609: deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
0610: fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
0611: will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
0612: provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
0613: of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
0614: internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”
0615: 
0616: You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
0617: communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by
0618: a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear
0619: the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
0620: desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed
0621: these feelings in my answer.
0622: 
0623: “I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is
0624: useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I
0625: shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,
0626: perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my
0627: friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
0628: destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
0629: determined.”
0630: 
0631: He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I
0632: should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have
0633: resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
0634: record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during
0635: the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This
0636: manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who
0637: know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and
0638: sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my
0639: task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
0640: with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in
0641: animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
0642: within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
0643: embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!
0644: 
0645: 
0646: 
0647: 
0648: Chapter 1
0649: 
0650: 
0651: I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
0652: distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years
0653: counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
0654: situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who
0655: knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
0656: business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
0657: affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
0658: marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
0659: husband and the father of a family.
0660: 
0661: As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
0662: refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a
0663: merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
0664: mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
0665: proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
0666: and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
0667: distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,
0668: therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
0669: daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
0670: wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
0671: was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
0672: He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
0673: so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in
0674: endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
0675: the world again through his credit and assistance.
0676: 
0677: Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
0678: months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,
0679: he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
0680: Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort
0681: had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
0682: it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
0683: the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
0684: merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
0685: his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
0686: reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
0687: of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
0688: 
0689: His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
0690: with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
0691: there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort
0692: possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
0693: her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and
0694: by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
0695: support life.
0696: 
0697: Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time
0698: was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
0699: decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
0700: her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt
0701: by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
0702: chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
0703: committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
0704: conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a
0705: relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
0706: 
0707: There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
0708: this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
0709: affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind
0710: which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
0711: strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
0712: late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
0713: a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and
0714: worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
0715: doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
0716: virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
0717: her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
0718: to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes
0719: and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
0720: sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
0721: with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
0722: benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
0723: constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During
0724: the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
0725: gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
0726: their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change
0727: of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
0728: as a restorative for her weakened frame.
0729: 
0730: From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born
0731: at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained
0732: for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each
0733: other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
0734: mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and
0735: my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
0736: first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something
0737: better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
0738: them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
0739: their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
0740: their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed
0741: towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
0742: of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
0743: every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,
0744: and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
0745: one train of enjoyment to me.
0746: 
0747: For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a
0748: daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five
0749: years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they
0750: passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent
0751: disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my
0752: mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
0753: passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
0754: relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
0755: afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
0756: attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
0757: of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
0758: shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
0759: accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,
0760: hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
0761: five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
0762: above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were
0763: dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her
0764: hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
0765: clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was
0766: clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
0767: her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
0768: her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
0769: and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.
0770: 
0771: The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
0772: admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was
0773: not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a
0774: German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with
0775: these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been
0776: long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their
0777: charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
0778: of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted
0779: himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its
0780: weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria
0781: was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
0782: a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
0783: abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.
0784: 
0785: When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of
0786: our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed
0787: to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
0788: than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
0789: permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
0790: charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed
0791: a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
0792: and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They
0793: consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza
0794: became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than
0795: sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
0796: my pleasures.
0797: 
0798: Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential
0799: attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my
0800: pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to
0801: my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my
0802: Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she
0803: presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
0804: seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth
0805: as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on
0806: her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other
0807: familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body
0808: forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than
0809: sister, since till death she was to be mine only.
0810: 
0811: 
0812: 
0813: 
0814: Chapter 2
0815: 
0816: 
0817: We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in
0818: our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of
0819: disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
0820: the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
0821: nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
0822: disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
0823: application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
0824: She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;
0825: and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss
0826: home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
0827: tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
0828: our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
0829: While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
0830: magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their
0831: causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
0832: Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
0833: gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
0834: earliest sensations I can remember.
0835: 
0836: On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
0837: up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
0838: country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,
0839: the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
0840: league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the
0841: lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my
0842: temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was
0843: indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
0844: myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry
0845: Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular
0846: talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
0847: its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He
0848: composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
0849: knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
0850: masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
0851: Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous
0852: train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
0853: of the infidels.
0854: 
0855: No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My
0856: parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
0857: We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
0858: their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
0859: which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly
0860: discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
0861: the development of filial love.
0862: 
0863: My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
0864: law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
0865: but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
0866: indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,
0867: nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
0868: possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth
0869: that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
0870: things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
0871: that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
0872: or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.
0873: 
0874: Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
0875: relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
0876: and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
0877: to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
0878: gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul
0879: of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
0880: Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
0881: her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was
0882: the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become
0883: sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that
0884: she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And
0885: Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet
0886: he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
0887: generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for
0888: adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
0889: beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
0890: ambition.
0891: 
0892: I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,
0893: before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of
0894: extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,
0895: in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which
0896: led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would
0897: account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my
0898: destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost
0899: forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent
0900: which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.
0901: 
0902: Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,
0903: therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my
0904: predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went
0905: on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the
0906: weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I
0907: chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
0908: with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
0909: facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new
0910: light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my
0911: discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my
0912: book and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste
0913: your time upon this; it is sad trash.”
0914: 
0915: If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me
0916: that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern
0917: system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers
0918: than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while
0919: those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I
0920: should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my
0921: imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my
0922: former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never
0923: have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance
0924: my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was
0925: acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest
0926: avidity.
0927: 
0928: When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this
0929: author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and
0930: studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
0931: treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always
0932: having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
0933: nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
0934: philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
0935: Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking
0936: up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his
0937: successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted
0938: appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same
0939: pursuit.
0940: 
0941: The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
0942: with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little
0943: more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
0944: lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,
0945: anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
0946: in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I
0947: had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
0948: human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
0949: ignorantly I had repined.
0950: 
0951: But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew
0952: more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their
0953: disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth
0954: century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of
0955: Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite
0956: studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a
0957: child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.
0958: Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest
0959: diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir
0960: of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an
0961: inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could
0962: banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but
0963: a violent death!
0964: 
0965: Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a
0966: promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which
0967: I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I
0968: attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
0969: want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was
0970: occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
0971: contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
0972: multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish
0973: reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.
0974: 
0975: When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
0976: Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It
0977: advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once
0978: with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,
0979: while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
0980: As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an
0981: old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
0982: soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
0983: remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found
0984: the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the
0985: shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld
0986: anything so utterly destroyed.
0987: 
0988: Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
0989: electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural
0990: philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
0991: the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
0992: electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
0993: All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
0994: Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
0995: some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
0996: accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
0997: be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
0998: despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
0999: most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
1000: occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
1001: and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
1002: would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
1003: real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
1004: mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
1005: being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.
1006: 
1007: Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
1008: are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me
1009: as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
1010: immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort
1011: made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
1012: then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was
1013: announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
1014: followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
1015: studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
1016: their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.
1017: 
1018: It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
1019: Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
1020: terrible destruction.
1021: 
1022: 
1023: 
1024: 
1025: Chapter 3
1026: 
1027: 
1028: When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
1029: should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had
1030: hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
1031: necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made
1032: acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My
1033: departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
1034: resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
1035: occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.
1036: 
1037: Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
1038: in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to
1039: persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first
1040: yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
1041: favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She
1042: attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
1043: of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
1044: imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother
1045: sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
1046: looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
1047: deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
1048: her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My
1049: children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were
1050: placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the
1051: consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
1052: my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy
1053: and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are
1054: not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
1055: death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”
1056: 
1057: She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
1058: I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
1059: by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
1060: soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so
1061: long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
1062: and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
1063: for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
1064: extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
1065: can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of
1066: the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
1067: evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has
1068: not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I
1069: describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at
1070: length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
1071: the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
1072: sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still
1073: duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
1074: rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
1075: spoiler has not seized.
1076: 
1077: My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
1078: was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of
1079: some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
1080: akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
1081: life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was
1082: unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
1083: all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.
1084: 
1085: She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
1086: She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
1087: zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
1088: her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
1089: when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
1090: She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
1091: 
1092: The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last
1093: evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
1094: him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His
1095: father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
1096: aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune
1097: of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when
1098: he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
1099: restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
1100: of commerce.
1101: 
1102: We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
1103: persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we
1104: retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
1105: other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the
1106: carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
1107: again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to
1108: renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last
1109: feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
1110: 
1111: I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
1112: the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
1113: amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
1114: pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I
1115: must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto
1116: been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
1117: repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
1118: Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself
1119: totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as
1120: I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I
1121: ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,
1122: thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
1123: longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. 
1124: Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
1125: repent.
1126: 
1127: I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
1128: journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the
1129: high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was
1130: conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.
1131: 
1132: The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
1133: some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil
1134: influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me
1135: from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s
1136: door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He
1137: was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
1138: asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches
1139: of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and
1140: partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal
1141: authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he
1142: said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”
1143: 
1144: I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with
1145: warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
1146: and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems
1147: and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,
1148: where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
1149: have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
1150: are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
1151: age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
1152: sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”
1153: 
1154: So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
1155: treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
1156: dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
1157: week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
1158: philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
1159: professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
1160: omitted.
1161: 
1162: I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
1163: considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
1164: returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
1165: shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
1166: repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
1167: favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a
1168: strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come
1169: to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been
1170: content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
1171: science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
1172: extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
1173: steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
1174: discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
1175: Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
1176: It was very different when the masters of the science sought
1177: immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
1178: the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
1179: itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
1180: science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of
1181: boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
1182: 
1183: Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
1184: residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
1185: acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
1186: abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information
1187: which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I
1188: could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
1189: sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.
1190: Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
1191: 
1192: Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing
1193: room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very
1194: unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
1195: aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
1196: temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person
1197: was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
1198: He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
1199: the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
1200: with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took
1201: a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
1202: its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he
1203: concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
1204: shall never forget:
1205: 
1206: “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,
1207: “promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters
1208: promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
1209: the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem
1210: only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
1211: crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses
1212: of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the
1213: heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of
1214: the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
1215: they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
1216: mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”
1217: 
1218: Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of
1219: the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul
1220: were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
1221: touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
1222: sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
1223: one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
1224: Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps
1225: already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
1226: unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
1227: 
1228: I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of
1229: insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
1230: had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,
1231: sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.
1232: There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
1233: devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
1234: natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His
1235: manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
1236: for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
1237: his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I
1238: gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
1239: given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little
1240: narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
1241: Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
1242: exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
1243: modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
1244: knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
1245: and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
1246: great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
1247: labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
1248: fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I
1249: listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
1250: or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
1251: prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
1252: terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
1253: instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
1254: made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
1255: labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
1256: procure.
1257: 
1258: “I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a
1259: disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of
1260: your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
1261: greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
1262: I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
1263: neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry
1264: chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your
1265: wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
1266: experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
1267: philosophy, including mathematics.”
1268: 
1269: He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
1270: various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and
1271: promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in
1272: the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of
1273: books which I had requested, and I took my leave.
1274: 
1275: Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
1276: 
1277: 
1278: 
1279: 
1280: Chapter 4
1281: 
1282: 
1283: From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
1284: most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
1285: I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
1286: which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the
1287: lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
1288: university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense
1289: and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
1290: physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In
1291: M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by
1292: dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
1293: good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways
1294: he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
1295: inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at
1296: first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and
1297: soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
1298: light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
1299: 
1300: As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
1301: was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
1302: my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,
1303: with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
1304: expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years
1305: passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
1306: engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
1307: hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive
1308: of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as
1309: others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
1310: a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
1311: A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
1312: infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
1313: continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
1314: solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
1315: years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
1316: instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
1317: university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
1318: acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
1319: depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
1320: residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought
1321: of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
1322: happened that protracted my stay.
1323: 
1324: One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
1325: the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
1326: life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
1327: It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
1328: mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
1329: acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
1330: inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
1331: thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
1332: natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
1333: animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
1334: study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the
1335: causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became
1336: acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
1337: must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
1338: In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
1339: mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever
1340: remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
1341: the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
1342: a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
1343: life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
1344: food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
1345: this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
1346: charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most
1347: insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the
1348: fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
1349: death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
1350: inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
1351: analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
1352: from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
1353: darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and
1354: wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
1355: of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
1356: many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
1357: science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
1358: secret.
1359: 
1360: Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not
1361: more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is
1362: true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
1363: discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of
1364: incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of
1365: generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing
1366: animation upon lifeless matter.
1367: 
1368: The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
1369: soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in
1370: painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
1371: most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so
1372: great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
1373: progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
1374: What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
1375: of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it
1376: all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a
1377: nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
1378: towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
1379: accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead
1380: and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
1381: ineffectual light.
1382: 
1383: I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
1384: express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
1385: which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
1386: of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that
1387: subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
1388: to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my
1389: precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
1390: knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
1391: to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
1392: will allow.
1393: 
1394: When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated
1395: a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
1396: Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
1397: prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
1398: fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
1399: difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the
1400: creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
1401: imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
1402: doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
1403: as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
1404: adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
1405: ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
1406: operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
1407: imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
1408: place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
1409: attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor
1410: could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
1411: argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I
1412: began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts
1413: formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first
1414: intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
1415: about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having
1416: formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
1417: collecting and arranging my materials, I began.
1418: 
1419: No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
1420: a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death
1421: appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and
1422: pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless
1423: me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
1424: owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his
1425: child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these
1426: reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
1427: matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
1428: renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
1429: 
1430: These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
1431: with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
1432: person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very
1433: brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
1434: next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone
1435: possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
1436: gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
1437: eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive
1438: the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
1439: of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
1440: clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
1441: then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
1442: to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was
1443: indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
1444: acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
1445: returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and
1446: disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
1447: frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
1448: and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
1449: I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
1450: their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The
1451: dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
1452: and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
1453: whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
1454: brought my work near to a conclusion.
1455: 
1456: The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
1457: one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
1458: bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
1459: vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the
1460: same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
1461: to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
1462: not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
1463: well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are
1464: pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
1465: hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any
1466: interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
1467: are equally neglected.”
1468: 
1469: I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could
1470: not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
1471: had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it
1472: were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
1473: until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
1474: should be completed.
1475: 
1476: I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
1477: to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was
1478: justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
1479: blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
1480: peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
1481: disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
1482: is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself
1483: has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
1484: those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
1485: study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
1486: mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
1487: whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
1488: affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his
1489: country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the
1490: empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
1491: 
1492: But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
1493: tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
1494: 
1495: My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
1496: silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
1497: Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
1498: watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always
1499: yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my
1500: occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
1501: to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had
1502: succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
1503: rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
1504: unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
1505: Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
1506: painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
1507: creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at
1508: the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone
1509: sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and
1510: amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself
1511: both of these when my creation should be complete.
1512: 
1513: 
1514: 
1515: 
1516: Chapter 5
1517: 
1518: 
1519: It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment
1520: of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I
1521: collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a
1522: spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was
1523: already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
1524: panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
1525: half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature
1526: open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
1527: 
1528: How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
1529: the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to
1530: form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as
1531: beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered
1532: the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
1533: black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
1534: luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
1535: that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
1536: they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
1537: 
1538: The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
1539: of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
1540: purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had
1541: deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour
1542: that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty
1543: of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
1544: heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I
1545: rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
1546: bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude
1547: succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the
1548: bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
1549: But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
1550: dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
1551: the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
1552: but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
1553: the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
1554: held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
1555: form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
1556: I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
1557: teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
1558: yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
1559: shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had
1560: created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
1561: may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
1562: inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have
1563: spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
1564: detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the
1565: courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
1566: during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
1567: agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
1568: it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I
1569: had so miserably given life.
1570: 
1571: Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy
1572: again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I
1573: had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
1574: muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
1575: such as even Dante could not have conceived.
1576: 
1577: I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
1578: hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly
1579: sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with
1580: this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
1581: been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
1582: hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!
1583: 
1584: Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my
1585: sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple
1586: and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates
1587: of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into
1588: the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
1589: wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my
1590: view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
1591: felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
1592: from a black and comfortless sky.
1593: 
1594: I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
1595: bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I
1596: traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or
1597: what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I
1598: hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:
1599:  
1600:  Like one who, on a lonely road,
1601:  Doth walk in fear and dread,
1602:  And, having once turned round, walks on,
1603:  And turns no more his head;
1604:  Because he knows a frightful fiend
1605:  Doth close behind him tread.
1606:  
1607:  [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]
1608: 
1609: 
1610: 
1611: Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
1612: diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
1613: but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
1614: towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed
1615: that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and
1616: on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,
1617: instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,
1618: “how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at
1619: the very moment of my alighting!”
1620: 
1621: Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back
1622: to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
1623: to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror
1624: and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
1625: calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial
1626: manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for
1627: some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
1628: permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said
1629: he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
1630: necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
1631: and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
1632: answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch
1633: schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins
1634: a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his
1635: affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
1636: permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
1637: knowledge.”
1638: 
1639: “It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left
1640: my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”
1641: 
1642: “Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
1643: you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their
1644: account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping
1645: short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill
1646: you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for
1647: several nights.”
1648: 
1649: “You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
1650: occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
1651: but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
1652: end and that I am at length free.”
1653: 
1654: I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
1655: allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a
1656: quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and
1657: the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my
1658: apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to
1659: behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
1660: Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
1661: stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the
1662: lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a
1663: cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as
1664: children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
1665: waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
1666: fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
1667: from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good
1668: fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy
1669: had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.
1670: 
1671: We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
1672: but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed
1673: me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
1674: beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
1675: place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
1676: Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
1677: but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
1678: for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
1679: laughter frightened and astonished him.
1680: 
1681: “My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,
1682: is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the
1683: cause of all this?”
1684: 
1685: “Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I
1686: thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can
1687: tell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;
1688: I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
1689: 
1690: Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he
1691: anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I
1692: was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not
1693: recover my senses for a long, long time.
1694: 
1695: This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
1696: several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I
1697: afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness
1698: for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
1699: Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
1700: disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
1701: nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
1702: did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
1703: action that he could towards them.
1704: 
1705: But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
1706: unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
1707: The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever
1708: before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my
1709: words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
1710: of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I
1711: continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
1712: indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
1713: 
1714: By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
1715: grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became
1716: capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
1717: perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
1718: buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was
1719: a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
1720: convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
1721: my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as
1722: cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
1723: 
1724: “Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good
1725: you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you
1726: promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever
1727: repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I
1728: have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”
1729: 
1730: “You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
1731: well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I
1732: may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”
1733: 
1734: I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on
1735: whom I dared not even think?
1736: 
1737: “Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of
1738: colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father
1739: and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your
1740: own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at
1741: your long silence.”
1742: 
1743: “Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first
1744: thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and
1745: who are so deserving of my love?”
1746: 
1747: “If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad
1748: to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
1749: your cousin, I believe.”
1750: 
1751: 
1752: 
1753: 
1754: Chapter 6
1755: 
1756: 
1757: Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my
1758: own Elizabeth:
1759: 
1760: “My dearest Cousin,
1761: 
1762: “You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
1763: kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are
1764: forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,
1765: is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought
1766: that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
1767: restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have
1768: prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
1769: long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to
1770: perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on
1771: your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
1772: guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
1773: your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed
1774: you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
1775: intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
1776: 
1777: “Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and
1778: friends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he
1779: asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
1780: care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would
1781: be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full
1782: of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter
1783: into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
1784: elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of
1785: a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your
1786: powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
1787: time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
1788: lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
1789: and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
1790: 
1791: “Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
1792: place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they
1793: never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are
1794: regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up
1795: my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
1796: none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one
1797: change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on
1798: what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;
1799: I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,
1800: her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
1801: third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
1802: through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
1803: after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed
1804: this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
1805: to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our
1806: country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
1807: prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less
1808: distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
1809: lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
1810: more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
1811: thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in
1812: our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
1813: fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
1814: sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
1815: 
1816: “Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I
1817: recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
1818: glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
1819: Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so
1820: frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
1821: by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
1822: which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;
1823: Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not
1824: mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
1825: you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
1826: Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
1827: yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She
1828: thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
1829: phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
1830: 
1831: “When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own
1832: grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness
1833: with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other
1834: trials were reserved for her.
1835: 
1836: “One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
1837: exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The
1838: conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
1839: deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
1840: partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
1841: confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months
1842: after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
1843: repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she
1844: was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
1845: and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
1846: for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature
1847: to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her
1848: repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,
1849: but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
1850: brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz
1851: into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
1852: now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,
1853: at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;
1854: and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,
1855: and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her
1856: expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
1857: 
1858: “I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
1859: William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
1860: sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he
1861: smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
1862: health. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron
1863: is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.
1864: 
1865: “Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
1866: gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield
1867: has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
1868: marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly
1869: sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your
1870: favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes
1871: since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already
1872: recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
1873: lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much
1874: older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
1875: everybody.
1876: 
1877: “I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety
1878: returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one
1879: word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his
1880: kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely
1881: grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat
1882: you, write!
1883: 
1884: “Elizabeth Lavenza.
1885: 
1886: 
1887: “Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”
1888: 
1889: 
1890: 
1891: “Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her
1892: letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety
1893: they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but
1894: my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another
1895: fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
1896: 
1897: One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
1898: several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a
1899: kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
1900: sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
1901: beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
1902: to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored
1903: to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
1904: of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my
1905: apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
1906: perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
1907: previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of
1908: no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture
1909: when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
1910: had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the
1911: subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
1912: modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
1913: itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What
1914: could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he
1915: had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
1916: were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I
1917: writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
1918: Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
1919: sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
1920: total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I
1921: thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly
1922: that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
1923: me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
1924: that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in
1925: him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
1926: I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
1927: 
1928: M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
1929: almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
1930: more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n
1931: the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has
1932: outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A
1933: youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly
1934: as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
1935: he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,
1936: ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,
1937: “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
1938: Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was
1939: myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”
1940: 
1941: M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned
1942: the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
1943: 
1944: Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his
1945: literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He
1946: came to the university with the design of making himself complete
1947: master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
1948: the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no
1949: inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
1950: scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
1951: languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
1952: the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
1953: wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
1954: great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
1955: only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I
1956: did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
1957: I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
1958: amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
1959: repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
1960: elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of
1961: any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to
1962: consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns
1963: of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How
1964: different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!
1965: 
1966: Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was
1967: fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
1968: accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
1969: and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this
1970: delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved
1971: friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an
1972: unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become
1973: acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent
1974: cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
1975: its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
1976: 
1977: The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily
1978: which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a
1979: pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a
1980: personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded
1981: with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval
1982: had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
1983: that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.
1984: 
1985: We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits
1986: had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
1987: salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
1988: the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the
1989: intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
1990: Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
1991: me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
1992: Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
1993: elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish
1994: pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
1995: affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature
1996: who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
1997: When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
1998: delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
1999: ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
2000: bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I
2001: was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
2002: upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
2003: invincible burden.
2004: 
2005: Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
2006: exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
2007: his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
2008: astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
2009: imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
2010: fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew
2011: me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.
2012: 
2013: We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
2014: dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were
2015: high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.

2020: Chapter 7
2021: 
2022: 
2023: On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—
2024: 
2025: “My dear Victor,
2026: 
2027: “You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
2028: your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
2029: lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But
2030: that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be
2031: your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
2032: behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can
2033: I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
2034: our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
2035: son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
2036: impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
2037: which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
2038: 
2039: “William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
2040: my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!
2041: 
2042: “I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
2043: circumstances of the transaction.
2044: 
2045: “Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
2046: walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
2047: our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
2048: returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
2049: on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until
2050: they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
2051: his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William
2052: had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
2053: afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.
2054: 
2055: “This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
2056: until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have
2057: returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with
2058: torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
2059: lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
2060: Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I
2061: discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and
2062: active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
2063: print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.
2064: 
2065: “He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
2066: countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to
2067: see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
2068: and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
2069: victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my
2070: darling child!’
2071: 
2072: “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again
2073: lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same
2074: evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
2075: miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and
2076: was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We
2077: have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
2078: are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
2079: 
2080: “Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps
2081: continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
2082: her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an
2083: additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
2084: Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live
2085: to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!
2086: 
2087: “Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
2088: but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
2089: festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my
2090: friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
2091: with hatred for your enemies.
2092: 
2093: “Your affectionate and afflicted father,
2094: 
2095: “Alphonse Frankenstein.
2096: 
2097: 
2098: 
2099: “Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”
2100: 
2101: 
2102: 
2103: Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was
2104: surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first
2105: expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the
2106: table, and covered my face with my hands.
2107: 
2108: “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
2109: weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,
2110: what has happened?”
2111: 
2112: I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the
2113: room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of
2114: Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.
2115: 
2116: “I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;
2117: “your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”
2118: 
2119: “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”
2120: 
2121: During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
2122: he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,
2123: “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had
2124: seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
2125: untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How
2126: much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little
2127: fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
2128: he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
2129: A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer
2130: be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
2131: survivors.”
2132: 
2133: Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
2134: impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in
2135: solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a
2136: cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
2137: 
2138: My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed
2139: to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I
2140: drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain
2141: the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through
2142: scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
2143: How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and
2144: desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
2145: might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
2146: done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
2147: dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
2148: although I was unable to define them.
2149: 
2150: I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I
2151: contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
2152: snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By
2153: degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
2154: towards Geneva.
2155: 
2156: The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
2157: approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black
2158: sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a
2159: child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
2160: wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
2161: placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”
2162: 
2163: I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
2164: these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
2165: happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved
2166: country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again
2167: beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
2168: lake!
2169: 
2170: Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also
2171: closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still
2172: more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I
2173: foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human
2174: beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
2175: circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
2176: conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.
2177: 
2178: It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
2179: of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at
2180: Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky
2181: was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot
2182: where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the
2183: town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
2184: During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont
2185: Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach
2186: rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
2187: progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain
2188: coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
2189: 
2190: I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
2191: increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
2192: over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of
2193: Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
2194: lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
2195: every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
2196: from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
2197: Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The
2198: most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
2199: lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of
2200: Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another
2201: darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the
2202: east of the lake.
2203: 
2204: While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with
2205: a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
2206: hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy
2207: funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the
2208: gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
2209: fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
2210: illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
2211: gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
2212: to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
2213: dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
2214: shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that
2215: idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth
2216: chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure
2217: passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could
2218: have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not
2219: doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
2220: fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
2221: another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
2222: perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
2223: south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
2224: 
2225: I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still
2226: continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I
2227: revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
2228: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
2229: the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had
2230: now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
2231: was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a
2232: depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
2233: murdered my brother?
2234: 
2235: No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
2236: night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not
2237: feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
2238: scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast
2239: among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
2240: of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
2241: of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
2242: to destroy all that was dear to me.
2243: 
2244: Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were
2245: open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to
2246: discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
2247: made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A
2248: being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
2249: midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I
2250: remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
2251: the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
2252: delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that
2253: if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
2254: looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature
2255: of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited
2256: as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would
2257: be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
2258: overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and
2259: I resolved to remain silent.
2260: 
2261: It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I
2262: told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
2263: to attend their usual hour of rising.
2264: 
2265: Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
2266: stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my
2267: departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained
2268: to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
2269: mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s
2270: desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
2271: by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
2272: but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
2273: sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my
2274: tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest
2275: entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
2276: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you
2277: had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
2278: delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
2279: alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
2280: sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
2281: Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor
2282: William! he was our darling and our pride!”
2283: 
2284: Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal
2285: agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the
2286: wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
2287: a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more
2288: minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.
2289: 
2290: “She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused
2291: herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
2292: very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”
2293: 
2294: “The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt
2295: to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
2296: winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he
2297: was free last night!”
2298: 
2299: “I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of
2300: wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No
2301: one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be
2302: convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit
2303: that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
2304: could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”
2305: 
2306: “Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is
2307: wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”
2308: 
2309: “No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
2310: almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
2311: confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,
2312: leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will
2313: then hear all.”
2314: 
2315: He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William
2316: had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
2317: bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,
2318: happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
2319: murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
2320: had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant
2321: instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
2322: any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
2323: Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl
2324: confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
2325: manner.
2326: 
2327: This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
2328: earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,
2329: good Justine, is innocent.”
2330: 
2331: At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
2332: on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
2333: after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
2334: some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,
2335: “Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
2336: poor William.”
2337: 
2338: “We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had
2339: rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
2340: depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”
2341: 
2342: “My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”
2343: 
2344: “If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be
2345: tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”
2346: 
2347: This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
2348: Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
2349: had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
2350: brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to
2351: announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
2352: madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the
2353: creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
2354: existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
2355: which I had let loose upon the world?
2356: 
2357: We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last
2358: beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
2359: her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
2360: it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
2361: She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear
2362: cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some
2363: means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she
2364: be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
2365: upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
2366: lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
2367: love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I
2368: never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;
2369: and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
2370: William.”
2371: 
2372: “She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall
2373: be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance
2374: of her acquittal.”
2375: 
2376: “How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
2377: and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to
2378: see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
2379: hopeless and despairing.” She wept.
2380: 
2381: “Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she
2382: is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the
2383: activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of
2384: partiality.”
2385: 
2386: 
2387: 
2388: 
2389: Chapter 8
2390: 
2391: 
2392: We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to
2393: commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
2394: as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of
2395: this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to
2396: be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
2397: cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of
2398: innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
2399: aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
2400: Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
2401: to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
2402: ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I
2403: have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I
2404: was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
2405: been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
2406: exculpated her who suffered through me.
2407: 
2408: The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and
2409: her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
2410: feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in
2411: innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
2412: thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
2413: excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
2414: imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She
2415: was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
2416: her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
2417: worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the
2418: court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
2419: seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
2420: recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
2421: her utter guiltlessness.
2422: 
2423: The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
2424: charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined
2425: against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
2426: of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on
2427: which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
2428: perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
2429: murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she
2430: did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
2431: and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
2432: o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
2433: replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
2434: if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she
2435: fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The
2436: picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
2437: and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
2438: which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
2439: his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
2440: 
2441: Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her
2442: countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
2443: expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
2444: desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
2445: although variable voice.
2446: 
2447: “God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I
2448: do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence
2449: on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
2450: against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my
2451: judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
2452: doubtful or suspicious.”
2453: 
2454: She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
2455: the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
2456: house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from
2457: Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked
2458: her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was
2459: alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
2460: when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
2461: several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
2462: unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most
2463: of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
2464: she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
2465: It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
2466: to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
2467: it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when
2468: questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
2469: a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
2470: Concerning the picture she could give no account.
2471: 
2472: “I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and
2473: fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of
2474: explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left
2475: to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
2476: placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no
2477: enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
2478: wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity
2479: afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the
2480: jewel, to part with it again so soon?
2481: 
2482: “I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
2483: hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
2484: character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
2485: guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
2486: innocence.”
2487: 
2488: Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
2489: they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
2490: supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
2491: forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
2492: dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
2493: when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
2494: the court.
2495: 
2496: “I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who
2497: was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
2498: with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may
2499: therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
2500: when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
2501: pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
2502: know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived
2503: in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
2504: two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
2505: benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
2506: her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
2507: attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
2508: the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
2509: uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was
2510: warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
2511: most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
2512: notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
2513: on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to
2514: the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
2515: I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
2516: her.”
2517: 
2518: A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful
2519: appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
2520: favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
2521: renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She
2522: herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own
2523: agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed
2524: in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a
2525: minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
2526: betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the
2527: horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
2528: the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
2529: I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did
2530: not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
2531: remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
2532: 
2533: I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to
2534: the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
2535: question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
2536: visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine
2537: was condemned.
2538: 
2539: I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before
2540: experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon
2541: them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
2542: heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I
2543: addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.
2544: “That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a
2545: case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
2546: condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
2547: decisive.”
2548: 
2549: This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had
2550: my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would
2551: believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I
2552: hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
2553: 
2554: “My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all
2555: judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
2556: should escape. But she has confessed.”
2557: 
2558: This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
2559: Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I
2560: ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as
2561: my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
2562: Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
2563: committed a murder.”
2564: 
2565: Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
2566: cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
2567: judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,
2568: “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany
2569: me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet
2570: I could not refuse.
2571: 
2572: We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some
2573: straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
2574: her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
2575: her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My
2576: cousin wept also.
2577: 
2578: “Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
2579: I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I
2580: was not so miserable as I am now.”
2581: 
2582: “And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also
2583: join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her
2584: voice was suffocated with sobs.
2585: 
2586: “Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,
2587: if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you
2588: guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had
2589: yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
2590: assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
2591: moment, but your own confession.”
2592: 
2593: “I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might
2594: obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
2595: all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was
2596: condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
2597: until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I
2598: was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
2599: I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
2600: on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?
2601: In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
2602: miserable.”
2603: 
2604: She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my
2605: sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed
2606: aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
2607: of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
2608: Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in
2609: heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I
2610: am to suffer ignominy and death.”
2611: 
2612: “Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
2613: Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I
2614: will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony
2615: hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!
2616: You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
2617: No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”
2618: 
2619: Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;
2620: “that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to
2621: endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
2622: me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the
2623: fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
2624: the will of heaven!”
2625: 
2626: During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,
2627: where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!
2628: Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
2629: the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such
2630: deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
2631: uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When
2632: she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very
2633: kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”
2634: 
2635: I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more
2636: convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you
2637: had confessed, he did not credit it.”
2638: 
2639: “I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest
2640: gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is
2641: the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than
2642: half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my
2643: innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”
2644: 
2645: Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
2646: gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the
2647: never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
2648: consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
2649: the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
2650: moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and
2651: despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
2652: me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with
2653: Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear
2654: herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I
2655: cannot live in this world of misery.”
2656: 
2657: Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
2658: repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice
2659: of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,
2660: my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
2661: preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
2662: suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”
2663: 
2664: And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence
2665: failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
2666: criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant
2667: appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers
2668: and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
2669: avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
2670: but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She
2671: perished on the scaffold as a murderess!
2672: 
2673: From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
2674: voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my
2675: father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
2676: the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
2677: are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
2678: the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
2679: Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
2680: who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
2681: thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
2682: countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
2683: in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
2684: his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
2685: pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!
2686: 
2687: Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
2688: I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and
2689: Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
2690: 
2691: 
2692: 
2693: 
2694: Chapter 9
2695: 
2696: 
2697: Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
2698: been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
2699: inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
2700: and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed
2701: freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
2702: heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
2703: like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond
2704: description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet
2705: behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
2706: I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
2707: when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
2708: beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
2709: which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
2710: from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and
2711: the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
2712: such as no language can describe.
2713: 
2714: This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never
2715: entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned
2716: the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
2717: solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.
2718: 
2719: My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition
2720: and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his
2721: serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and
2722: awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
2723: “Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer
2724: also? No one could love a child more than I loved your
2725: brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but
2726: is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting
2727: their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty
2728: owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
2729: or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for
2730: society.”
2731: 
2732: This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I
2733: should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if
2734: remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
2735: other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of
2736: despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.
2737: 
2738: About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was
2739: particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at
2740: ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
2741: hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
2742: to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had
2743: retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the
2744: water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and
2745: sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
2746: pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I
2747: was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
2748: unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
2749: heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
2750: interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,
2751: I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
2752: might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,
2753: when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
2754: loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my
2755: father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them
2756: exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
2757: among them?
2758: 
2759: At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my
2760: mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that
2761: could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
2762: unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had
2763: created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling
2764: that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,
2765: which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
2766: There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained
2767: behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of
2768: him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to
2769: extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I
2770: reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
2771: of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
2772: Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished
2773: to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his
2774: head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.
2775: 
2776: Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply
2777: shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and
2778: desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
2779: pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
2780: then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted
2781: and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
2782: wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our
2783: future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from
2784: the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
2785: smiles.
2786: 
2787: “When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of
2788: Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
2789: appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
2790: injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
2791: days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
2792: reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
2793: appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am
2794: certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
2795: if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
2796: she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake
2797: of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
2798: a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
2799: it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human
2800: being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to
2801: remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel
2802: she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
2803: Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
2804: assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on
2805: the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
2806: endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
2807: assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
2808: and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
2809: scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
2810: wretch.”
2811: 
2812: I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,
2813: but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my
2814: countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you
2815: must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how
2816: deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of
2817: despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
2818: tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the
2819: friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost
2820: the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are
2821: true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
2822: country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our
2823: peace?”
2824: 
2825: And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every
2826: other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my
2827: heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
2828: that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.
2829: 
2830: Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
2831: heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
2832: ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
2833: influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting
2834: limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
2835: pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.
2836: 
2837: Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
2838: sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
2839: exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
2840: sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left
2841: my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought
2842: in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
2843: my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed
2844: towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my
2845: boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought
2846: had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
2847: 
2848: I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards
2849: hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
2850: injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the
2851: middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
2852: Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The
2853: weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
2854: the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung
2855: me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
2856: the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
2857: Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
2858: almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
2859: displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,
2860: the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
2861: Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
2862: impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
2863: among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was
2864: augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and
2865: shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
2866: earth, the habitations of another race of beings.
2867: 
2868: I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river
2869: forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that
2870: overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This
2871: valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
2872: picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The
2873: high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no
2874: more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached
2875: the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
2876: marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and
2877: magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,
2878: and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.
2879: 
2880: A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
2881: journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
2882: recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
2883: lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing
2884: accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the
2885: kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief
2886: and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my
2887: animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
2888: myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on
2889: the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.
2890: 
2891: At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded
2892: to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.
2893: For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid
2894: lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of
2895: the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds
2896: acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head
2897: upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed
2898: the giver of oblivion.
2899: 
2900: 
2901: 
2902: 
2903: Chapter 10
2904: 
2905: 
2906: I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside
2907: the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
2908: with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
2909: barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
2910: me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
2911: scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
2912: presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling
2913: waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
2914: avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
2915: accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
2916: was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
2917: their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
2918: greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me
2919: from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
2920: grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they
2921: diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
2922: last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
2923: waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
2924: had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the
2925: unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
2926: and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all
2927: gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
2928: 
2929: Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of
2930: soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
2931: thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
2932: summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those
2933: mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
2934: in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was
2935: brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
2936: Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
2937: and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.
2938: It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
2939: soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
2940: The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
2941: effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
2942: cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
2943: acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
2944: solitary grandeur of the scene.
2945: 
2946: The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
2947: windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
2948: mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots
2949: the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
2950: broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
2951: leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
2952: other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
2953: of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
2954: particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
2955: in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
2956: destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or
2957: luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
2958: I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
2959: which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
2960: mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
2961: poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
2962: received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of
2963: sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
2964: them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,
2965: thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
2966: every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
2967: convey to us.
2968: 
2969:   We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
2970:      We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
2971:   We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
2972:      Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
2973:   It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
2974:      The path of its departure still is free.
2975:   Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
2976:      Nought may endure but mutability!
2977: 
2978: 
2979: It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some
2980: time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
2981: both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated
2982: the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very
2983: uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
2984: interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a
2985: league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The
2986: opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I
2987: now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
2988: and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess
2989: of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,
2990: or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
2991: whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering
2992: peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
2993: before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,
2994: “Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
2995: beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
2996: away from the joys of life.”
2997: 
2998: As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
2999: advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the
3000: crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his
3001: stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was
3002: troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
3003: but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I
3004: perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
3005: that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and
3006: horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
3007: mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
3008: combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
3009: rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
3010: observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
3011: and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
3012: detestation and contempt.
3013: 
3014: “Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do
3015: not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
3016: Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,
3017: oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore
3018: those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”
3019: 
3020: “I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the
3021: wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
3022: living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
3023: to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
3024: one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?
3025: Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of
3026: mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and
3027: you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it
3028: be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”
3029: 
3030: “Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too
3031: mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with
3032: your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I
3033: so negligently bestowed.”
3034: 
3035: My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
3036: feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
3037: 
3038: He easily eluded me and said,
3039: 
3040: “Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
3041: on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
3042: increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of
3043: anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made
3044: me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
3045: joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in
3046: opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and
3047: docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
3048: the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
3049: other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
3050: clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;
3051: I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
3052: drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I
3053: alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made
3054: me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”
3055: 
3056: “Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you
3057: and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
3058: in which one must fall.”
3059: 
3060: “How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
3061: favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
3062: compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed
3063: with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my
3064: creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,
3065: who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and
3066: dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the
3067: caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
3068: only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they
3069: are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind
3070: knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
3071: my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep
3072: no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my
3073: wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
3074: them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
3075: not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
3076: swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be
3077: moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard
3078: that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.
3079: But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
3080: are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen
3081: to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
3082: a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the
3083: eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
3084: and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”
3085: 
3086: “Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of
3087: which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and
3088: author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
3089: light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
3090: You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power
3091: to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from
3092: the sight of your detested form.”
3093: 
3094: “Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands
3095: before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from
3096: thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant
3097: me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this
3098: from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
3099: this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
3100: the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
3101: to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
3102: world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,
3103: whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
3104: life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
3105: your own speedy ruin.”
3106: 
3107: As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart
3108: was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
3109: various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
3110: his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
3111: resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
3112: brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
3113: For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards
3114: his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
3115: complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with
3116: his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
3117: rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
3118: entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy
3119: heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating
3120: myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
3121: his tale.
3122: 
3123: 
3124: 
3125: 
3126: Chapter 11
3127: 
3128: 
3129: “It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of
3130: my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
3131: A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,
3132: and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
3133: learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By
3134: degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
3135: was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled
3136: me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now
3137: suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,
3138: descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
3139: Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
3140: touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with
3141: no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light
3142: became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I
3143: walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the
3144: forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting
3145: from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This
3146: roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
3147: found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst
3148: at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.
3149: 
3150: “It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it
3151: were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted
3152: your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some
3153: clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of
3154: night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could
3155: distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat
3156: down and wept.
3157: 
3158: “Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
3159: pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
3160: trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,
3161: but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.
3162: I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with
3163: which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct
3164: ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,
3165: and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
3166: all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could
3167: distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with
3168: pleasure.
3169: 
3170: “Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
3171: greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each
3172: other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with
3173: drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted
3174: when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
3175: ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
3176: often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,
3177: with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
3178: boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I
3179: tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
3180: Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
3181: uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
3182: silence again.
3183: 
3184: “The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
3185: form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My
3186: sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every
3187: day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to
3188: perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from
3189: the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the
3190: sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
3191: thrush were sweet and enticing.
3192: 
3193: “One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been
3194: left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
3195: warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live
3196: embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,
3197: I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I
3198: examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
3199: composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
3200: and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the
3201: operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
3202: dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching
3203: the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
3204: collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a
3205: plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with
3206: it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I
3207: covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
3208: upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank
3209: into sleep.
3210: 
3211: “It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
3212: I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I
3213: observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
3214: embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I
3215: found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
3216: the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found
3217: some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
3218: tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I
3219: tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
3220: the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this
3221: operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.
3222: 
3223: “Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day
3224: searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When
3225: I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto
3226: inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be
3227: more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the
3228: loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how
3229: to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of
3230: this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
3231: it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
3232: towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at
3233: length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken
3234: place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
3235: appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold
3236: damp substance that covered the ground.
3237: 
3238: “It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
3239: shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
3240: had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This
3241: was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great
3242: curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,
3243: near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on
3244: hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
3245: hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
3246: hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever
3247: before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted
3248: by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
3249: penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
3250: and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell
3251: after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the
3252: remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
3253: milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by
3254: fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
3255: 
3256: “It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
3257: shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my
3258: travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a
3259: wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
3260: at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The
3261: huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
3262: turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
3263: placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One
3264: of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within
3265: the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
3266: The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
3267: grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
3268: escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
3269: quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
3270: beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
3271: and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
3272: dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
3273: low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,
3274: was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
3275: although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an
3276: agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
3277: 
3278: “Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
3279: however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
3280: from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my
3281: kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could
3282: remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back
3283: of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
3284: sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had
3285: crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived
3286: with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on
3287: occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and
3288: that was sufficient for me.
3289: 
3290: “Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I
3291: retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered
3292: too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I
3293: had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
3294: of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink
3295: more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by
3296: my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept
3297: perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
3298: tolerably warm.
3299: 
3300: “Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until
3301: something should occur which might alter my determination. It was
3302: indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
3303: the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with
3304: pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
3305: water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld
3306: a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The
3307: girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
3308: cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a
3309: coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
3310: hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost
3311: sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
3312: the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,
3313: seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
3314: countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with
3315: an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
3316: cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw
3317: the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
3318: behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
3319: house and sometimes in the yard.
3320: 
3321: “On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
3322: cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
3323: filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost
3324: imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
3325: Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
3326: but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
3327: old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The
3328: young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
3329: took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
3330: down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
3331: and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
3332: nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
3333: never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent
3334: countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
3335: manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air
3336: which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
3337: which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
3338: pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
3339: at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
3340: that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
3341: a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
3342: either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
3343: window, unable to bear these emotions.
3344: 
3345: “Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
3346: load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
3347: his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
3348: the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
3349: and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed
3350: pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
3351: placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her
3352: work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
3353: employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed
3354: thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
3355: cottage together.
3356: 
3357: “The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
3358: of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
3359: eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again
3360: occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
3361: cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
3362: Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
3363: creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
3364: with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
3365: figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
3366: eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The
3367: old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
3368: from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
3369: fields.
3370: 
3371: “Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the
3372: cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was
3373: delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
3374: pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening
3375: the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
3376: which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the
3377: instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in
3378: the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,
3379: but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
3380: harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since
3381: found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the
3382: science of words or letters.
3383: 
3384: “The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,
3385: extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”

3388: 
3389: 
3390: Chapter 12
3391: 
3392: 
3393: “I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the
3394: occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
3395: of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I
3396: remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from
3397: the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I
3398: might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would
3399: remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the
3400: motives which influenced their actions.
3401: 
3402: “The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman
3403: arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed
3404: after the first meal.
3405: 
3406: “This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
3407: The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in
3408: various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon
3409: perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or
3410: in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
3411: younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They
3412: performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with
3413: gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
3414: 
3415: “They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often
3416: went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,
3417: but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were
3418: miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
3419: should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They
3420: possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
3421: luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
3422: when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
3423: they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day
3424: looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they
3425: really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,
3426: but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
3427: were at first enigmatic.
3428: 
3429: “A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of
3430: the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they
3431: suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment
3432: consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
3433: one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
3434: could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,
3435: suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
3436: younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old
3437: man when they reserved none for themselves.
3438: 
3439: “This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,
3440: during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own
3441: consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on
3442: the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and
3443: roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.
3444: 
3445: “I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist
3446: their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day
3447: in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often
3448: took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home
3449: firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
3450: 
3451: “I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she
3452: opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great
3453: pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
3454: youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,
3455: that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the
3456: cottage and cultivating the garden.
3457: 
3458: “By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that
3459: these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
3460: feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words
3461: they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
3462: minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
3463: and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
3464: every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and
3465: the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
3466: objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
3467: mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having
3468: remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
3469: discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
3470: discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
3471: _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth
3472: and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
3473: one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or
3474: _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot
3475: describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of
3476: these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other
3477: words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,
3478: dearest, unhappy._
3479: 
3480: “I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of
3481: the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I
3482: felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw
3483: few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
3484: cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
3485: superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,
3486: often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that
3487: he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a
3488: cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
3489: even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
3490: with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I
3491: generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
3492: having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus
3493: with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
3494: unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
3495: friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
3496: cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
3497: man.
3498: 
3499: “I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked
3500: the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty
3501: and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little
3502: white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in
3503: the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
3504: obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and
3505: brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual
3506: astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible
3507: hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
3508: farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,
3509: yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,
3510: but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old
3511: man and Agatha.
3512: 
3513: “This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I
3514: discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when
3515: he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs
3516: for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend
3517: these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand
3518: the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,
3519: sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of
3520: conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I
3521: easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to
3522: the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become
3523: master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
3524: overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
3525: perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.
3526: 
3527: “I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,
3528: and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself
3529: in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that
3530: it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became
3531: fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was
3532: filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
3533: Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable
3534: deformity.
3535: 
3536: “As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow
3537: vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this
3538: time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of
3539: impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was
3540: coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
3541: Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they
3542: dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season
3543: advanced.
3544: 
3545: “The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
3546: not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its
3547: waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the
3548: earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
3549: 
3550: “My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I
3551: attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
3552: various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
3553: observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any
3554: moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected
3555: my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it
3556: was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those
3557: offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these
3558: labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
3559: once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good
3560: spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification
3561: of these terms.
3562: 
3563: “My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the
3564: motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to
3565: know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought
3566: (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
3567: these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the
3568: venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix
3569: flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be
3570: the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a
3571: thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
3572: me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
3573: demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and
3574: afterwards their love.
3575: 
3576: “These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
3577: the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but
3578: supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
3579: tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.
3580: It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
3581: intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved
3582: better treatment than blows and execration.
3583: 
3584: “The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
3585: aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been
3586: hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of
3587: cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves
3588: began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation
3589: for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
3590: unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
3591: nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
3592: and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”

3597: Chapter 13
3598: 
3599: 
3600: “I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate
3601: events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,
3602: have made me what I am.
3603: 
3604: “Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies
3605: cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy
3606: should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My
3607: senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and
3608: a thousand sights of beauty.
3609: 
3610: “It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
3611: from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children
3612: listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was
3613: melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
3614: paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired
3615: the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and
3616: the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.
3617: 
3618: “It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
3619: The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
3620: veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
3621: pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was
3622: musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,
3623: Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
3624: veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her
3625: hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
3626: dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
3627: proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
3628: a lovely pink.
3629: 
3630: “Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of
3631: sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of
3632: ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his
3633: eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I
3634: thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
3635: different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held
3636: out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
3637: well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to
3638: understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and
3639: dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some
3640: conversation took place between him and his father, and the young
3641: stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,
3642: but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.
3643: 
3644: “I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds
3645: and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
3646: by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I
3647: did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness
3648: through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
3649: morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of
3650: delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed
3651: the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made
3652: signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
3653: came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
3654: expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I
3655: found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger
3656: repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;
3657: and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the
3658: same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty
3659: words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had
3660: before understood, but I profited by the others.
3661: 
3662: “As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they
3663: separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night
3664: sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
3665: by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely
3666: guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to
3667: understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
3668: it utterly impossible.
3669: 
3670: “The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual
3671: occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the
3672: old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
3673: beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
3674: eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
3675: dying away like a nightingale of the woods.
3676: 
3677: “When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
3678: declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
3679: sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old
3680: man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to
3681: explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
3682: bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
3683: 
3684: “The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
3685: that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
3686: Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the
3687: knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most
3688: of the words uttered by my protectors.
3689: 
3690: “In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
3691: the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
3692: scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
3693: the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
3694: rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
3695: shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never
3696: ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
3697: treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.
3698: 
3699: “My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily
3700: master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than
3701: the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
3702: accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
3703: was spoken.
3704: 
3705: “While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as
3706: it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
3707: for wonder and delight.
3708: 
3709: “The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins
3710: of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not
3711: Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this
3712: work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the
3713: Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history
3714: and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave
3715: me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
3716: nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous
3717: genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue
3718: of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the
3719: decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard
3720: of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the
3721: hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
3722: 
3723: “These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was
3724: man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
3725: vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
3726: principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
3727: godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
3728: that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
3729: record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
3730: abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I
3731: could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
3732: even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
3733: vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and
3734: loathing.
3735: 
3736: “Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
3737: While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the
3738: Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I
3739: heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
3740: poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
3741: 
3742: “The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the
3743: possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
3744: unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with
3745: only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
3746: except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
3747: waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of
3748: my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I
3749: possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,
3750: endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even
3751: of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could
3752: subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with
3753: less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked
3754: around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot
3755: upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
3756: 
3757: “I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
3758: upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
3759: knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor
3760: known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
3761: 
3762: “Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it
3763: has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to
3764: shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one
3765: means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state
3766: which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good
3767: feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
3768: cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
3769: through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and
3770: unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of
3771: becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the
3772: animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild
3773: exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
3774: Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!
3775: 
3776: “Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the
3777: difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
3778: father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
3779: older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
3780: in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
3781: knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
3782: bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
3783: 
3784: “But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my
3785: infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if
3786: they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I
3787: distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I
3788: then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being
3789: resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The
3790: question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.
3791: 
3792: “I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to
3793: return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various
3794: feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
3795: in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in
3796: an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”

3799: 
3800: 
3801: Chapter 14
3802: 
3803: 
3804: “Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was
3805: one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
3806: as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
3807: one so utterly inexperienced as I was.
3808: 
3809: “The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good
3810: family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
3811: respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred
3812: in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the
3813: highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in
3814: a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and
3815: possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
3816: taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.
3817: 
3818: “The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a
3819: Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some
3820: reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
3821: He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
3822: Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The
3823: injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;
3824: and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
3825: alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.
3826: 
3827: “Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
3828: indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
3829: court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
3830: looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain
3831: admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
3832: unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
3833: unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
3834: execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night
3835: and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,
3836: amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
3837: by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with
3838: contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
3839: her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
3840: youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
3841: a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
3842: 
3843: “The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
3844: on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in
3845: his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he
3846: should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to
3847: accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
3848: event as to the consummation of his happiness.
3849: 
3850: “During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for
3851: the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several
3852: letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
3853: express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old
3854: man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in
3855: the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and
3856: at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.
3857: 
3858: “I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence
3859: in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
3860: were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will
3861: give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
3862: as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat
3863: the substance of them to you.
3864: 
3865: “Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a
3866: slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
3867: the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and
3868: enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
3869: bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in
3870: the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
3871: intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
3872: followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
3873: impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
3874: returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
3875: allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
3876: the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
3877: emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and
3878: remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
3879: society was enchanting to her.
3880: 
3881: “The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night
3882: previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
3883: many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of
3884: his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his
3885: plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
3886: the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
3887: an obscure part of Paris.
3888: 
3889: “Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont
3890: Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
3891: opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.
3892: 
3893: “Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his
3894: departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she
3895: should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in
3896: expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society
3897: of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
3898: affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an
3899: interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie
3900: sang to him the divine airs of her native country.
3901: 
3902: “The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes
3903: of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
3904: plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a
3905: Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear
3906: lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer
3907: if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they
3908: inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
3909: to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and
3910: secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans
3911: were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
3912: 
3913: “The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their
3914: victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The
3915: plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were
3916: thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his
3917: dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay
3918: in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of
3919: her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged
3920: with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity
3921: for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a
3922: boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,
3923: he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the
3924: law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.
3925: 
3926: “He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the
3927: trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune
3928: and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.
3929: 
3930: “They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I
3931: discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for
3932: whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
3933: discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,
3934: became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with
3935: his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,
3936: as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.
3937: 
3938: “Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered
3939: him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could
3940: have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
3941: virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss
3942: of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The
3943: arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
3944: 
3945: “When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth
3946: and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
3947: lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous
3948: nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
3949: expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
3950: tyrannical mandate.
3951: 
3952: “A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told
3953: her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn
3954: had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
3955: French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to
3956: Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He
3957: intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
3958: servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
3959: property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.
3960: 
3961: “When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
3962: would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey
3963: was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse
3964: to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she
3965: heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where
3966: he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
3967: determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a
3968: sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,
3969: but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for
3970: Germany.
3971: 
3972: “She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
3973: of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her
3974: with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the
3975: Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country
3976: and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,
3977: into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
3978: which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in
3979: which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at
3980: the cottage of her lover.”

3985: Chapter 15
3986: 
3987: 
3988: “Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.
3989: I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
3990: their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.
3991: 
3992: “As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
3993: generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
3994: become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
3995: were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the
3996: progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred
3997: in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.
3998: 
3999: “One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I
4000: collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
4001: the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
4002: some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. 
4003: Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I
4004: had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume
4005: of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The
4006: possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually
4007: studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were
4008: employed in their ordinary occupations.
4009: 
4010: “I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced
4011: in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
4012: to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In
4013: the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
4014: story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
4015: what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
4016: never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and
4017: domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
4018: feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
4019: well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
4020: were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a
4021: more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
4022: contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon
4023: death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not
4024: pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
4025: the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
4026: understanding it.
4027: 
4028: “As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
4029: condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
4030: unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I
4031: was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I
4032: was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.
4033: ‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my
4034: annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did
4035: this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my
4036: destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to
4037: solve them.
4038: 
4039: “The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the
4040: histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book
4041: had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I
4042: learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch
4043: taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
4044: own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many
4045: things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very
4046: confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
4047: and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
4048: large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
4049: only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book
4050: developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned
4051: in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the
4052: greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
4053: far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
4054: were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these
4055: feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
4056: Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The
4057: patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
4058: firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
4059: been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
4060: have been imbued with different sensations.
4061: 
4062: “But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read
4063: it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
4064: a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
4065: picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
4066: exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity
4067: struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to
4068: any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
4069: in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a
4070: perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
4071: his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
4072: beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
4073: Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
4074: often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
4075: gall of envy rose within me.
4076: 
4077: “Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon
4078: after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
4079: the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had
4080: neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
4081: which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was
4082: your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You
4083: minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
4084: of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
4085: occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.
4086: Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
4087: origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
4088: which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
4089: and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
4090: horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful
4091: day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!
4092: Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
4093: disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
4094: image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
4095: very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
4096: and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’
4097: 
4098: “These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
4099: but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
4100: benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
4101: become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would
4102: compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn
4103: from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
4104: and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
4105: to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I
4106: postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
4107: attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
4108: Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every
4109: day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking
4110: until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.
4111: 
4112: “Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The
4113: presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
4114: found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha
4115: spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
4116: their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were
4117: contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
4118: mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only
4119: discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I
4120: cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person
4121: reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
4122: image and that inconstant shade.
4123: 
4124: “I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
4125: which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
4126: thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
4127: dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
4128: feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
4129: smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my
4130: sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s
4131: supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,
4132: and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.
4133: 
4134: “Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
4135: and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
4136: had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did
4137: not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my
4138: conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief
4139: delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
4140: apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
4141: towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the
4142: absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and
4143: their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
4144: casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the
4145: greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
4146: heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
4147: their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
4148: limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from
4149: me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were
4150: never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
4151: little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
4152: believe myself utterly unworthy of it.
4153: 
4154: “The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
4155: place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely
4156: directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
4157: protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
4158: fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
4159: I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
4160: person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
4161: beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
4162: thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
4163: the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
4164: be tolerated by my younger protectors.
4165: 
4166: “One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
4167: and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
4168: and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
4169: desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,
4170: he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
4171: sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his
4172: countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
4173: thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
4174: instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.
4175: 
4176: “My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
4177: would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a
4178: neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
4179: excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my
4180: limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting
4181: all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had
4182: placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived
4183: me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
4184: cottage.
4185: 
4186: “I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’
4187: 
4188: “I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am
4189: a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
4190: would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’
4191: 
4192: “‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what
4193: manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are
4194: from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to
4195: procure food for you.’
4196: 
4197: “‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is
4198: warmth and rest only that I need.’
4199: 
4200: “I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was
4201: precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence
4202: the interview, when the old man addressed me.
4203: 
4204: ‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you
4205: French?’
4206: 
4207: “‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that
4208: language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
4209: whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’
4210: 
4211: “‘Are they Germans?’
4212: 
4213: “‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an
4214: unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation
4215: or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never
4216: seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail
4217: there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’
4218: 
4219: “‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
4220: the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
4221: full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;
4222: and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’
4223: 
4224: “‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
4225: but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good
4226: dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
4227: beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
4228: ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
4229: monster.’
4230: 
4231: “‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
4232: you undeceive them?’
4233: 
4234: “‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
4235: feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I
4236: have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
4237: kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and
4238: it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’
4239: 
4240: “‘Where do these friends reside?’
4241: 
4242: “‘Near this spot.’
4243: 
4244: “The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly
4245: confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in
4246: undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
4247: there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
4248: sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
4249: to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’
4250: 
4251: “‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You
4252: raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,
4253: I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
4254: creatures.’
4255: 
4256: “‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only
4257: drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am
4258: unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
4259: judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’
4260: 
4261: “‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips
4262: first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall
4263: be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
4264: with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’
4265: 
4266: “‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’
4267: 
4268: “I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
4269: rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for
4270: firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
4271: remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that
4272: moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment
4273: to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the
4274: time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I
4275: seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’
4276: 
4277: “‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’
4278: 
4279: “At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and
4280: Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on
4281: beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her
4282: friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with
4283: supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in
4284: a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
4285: with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
4286: the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
4287: I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
4288: overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general
4289: tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”

4295: 
4296: 
4297: “Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I
4298: not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
4299: bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
4300: feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have
4301: destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
4302: their shrieks and misery.
4303: 
4304: “When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
4305: now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
4306: anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken
4307: the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
4308: through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable
4309: night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
4310: waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
4311: burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest
4312: or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
4313: finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
4314: havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
4315: the ruin.
4316: 
4317: “But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
4318: fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
4319: the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men
4320: that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness
4321: towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war
4322: against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
4323: and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.
4324: 
4325: “The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was
4326: impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid
4327: myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
4328: to reflection on my situation.
4329: 
4330: “The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
4331: degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
4332: cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
4333: conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that
4334: my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a
4335: fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I
4336: ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to
4337: have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
4338: been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be
4339: irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the
4340: cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
4341: party.
4342: 
4343: “These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound
4344: sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
4345: peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
4346: acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix
4347: tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that
4348: it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
4349: search of food.
4350: 
4351: “When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the
4352: well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.
4353: I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
4354: accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun
4355: mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I
4356: trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside
4357: of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the
4358: agony of this suspense.
4359: 
4360: “Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
4361: entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not
4362: understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
4363: which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix
4364: approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
4365: quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
4366: his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.
4367: 
4368: “‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,
4369: ‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose
4370: the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
4371: I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
4372: determination.’
4373: 
4374: “‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can
4375: never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest
4376: danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and
4377: my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason
4378: with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this
4379: place.’
4380: 
4381: “Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion
4382: entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
4383: departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
4384: 
4385: “I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
4386: utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken
4387: the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the
4388: feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to
4389: control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
4390: bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,
4391: of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
4392: exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
4393: tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had
4394: spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
4395: injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As
4396: night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
4397: and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
4398: I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
4399: operations.
4400: 
4401: “As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
4402: dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
4403: along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
4404: spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the
4405: dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
4406: my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
4407: nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my
4408: brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,
4409: and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the
4410: cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
4411: licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.
4412: 
4413: “As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
4414: the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.
4415: 
4416: “And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
4417: resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
4418: and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the
4419: thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you
4420: were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness
4421: than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had
4422: bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from
4423: these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
4424: You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
4425: this place I resolved to proceed.
4426: 
4427: “But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
4428: southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
4429: only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass
4430: through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I
4431: did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although
4432: towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,
4433: heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions
4434: and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
4435: But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I
4436: determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from
4437: any other being that wore the human form.
4438: 
4439: “My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was
4440: late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.
4441: I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
4442: human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
4443: rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
4444: of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,
4445: earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The
4446: mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
4447: and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
4448: deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow
4449: fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents
4450: now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
4451: often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me
4452: no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
4453: not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived
4454: on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
4455: and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
4456: manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.
4457: 
4458: “I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
4459: secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding
4460: that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
4461: after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
4462: cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
4463: the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
4464: appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of
4465: these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
4466: forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears
4467: again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
4468: thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.
4469: 
4470: “I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
4471: boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
4472: of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
4473: Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard
4474: the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
4475: of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
4476: towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
4477: someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides
4478: of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
4479: rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
4480: from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She
4481: was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
4482: animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
4483: who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On
4484: seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
4485: hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I
4486: hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
4487: which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my
4488: injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.
4489: 
4490: “This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being
4491: from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable
4492: pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of
4493: kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments
4494: before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by
4495: pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the
4496: agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
4497: 
4498: “For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
4499: cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,
4500: and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
4501: rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented
4502: also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
4503: infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,
4504: such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
4505: endured.
4506: 
4507: “After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The
4508: labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
4509: gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
4510: desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
4511: the enjoyment of pleasure.
4512: 
4513: “But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
4514: reached the environs of Geneva.
4515: 
4516: “It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
4517: the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
4518: to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
4519: enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
4520: behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
4521: 
4522: “At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
4523: which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
4524: running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
4525: infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
4526: little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
4527: imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and
4528: educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
4529: this peopled earth.
4530: 
4531: “Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
4532: towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
4533: his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his
4534: face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to
4535: hurt you; listen to me.’
4536: 
4537: “He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;
4538: ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You
4539: are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’
4540: 
4541: “‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’
4542: 
4543: “‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.
4544: Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’
4545: 
4546: “‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have
4547: sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
4548: 
4549: “The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
4550: despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
4551: moment he lay dead at my feet.
4552: 
4553: “I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
4554: triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;
4555: my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
4556: a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’
4557: 
4558: “As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his
4559: breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite
4560: of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I
4561: gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
4562: lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
4563: for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
4564: bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
4565: regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
4566: expressive of disgust and affright.
4567: 
4568: “Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only
4569: wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
4570: exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the
4571: attempt to destroy them.
4572: 
4573: “While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
4574: committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
4575: entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was
4576: sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
4577: whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
4578: loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose
4579: joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over
4580: her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would
4581: give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
4582: beloved, awake!’
4583: 
4584: “The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she
4585: indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus
4586: would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
4587: The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but
4588: she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever
4589: robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had
4590: its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of
4591: Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work
4592: mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
4593: the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.
4594: 
4595: “For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
4596: sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
4597: its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,
4598: and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
4599: passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have
4600: promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man
4601: will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
4602: would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species
4603: and have the same defects. This being you must create.”
4604: 
4605: 
4606: 
4607: 
4608: Chapter 17
4609: 
4610: 
4611: The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
4612: expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
4613: arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
4614: proposition. He continued,
4615: 
4616: “You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the
4617: interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone
4618: can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to
4619: concede.”
4620: 
4621: The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
4622: died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
4623: as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
4624: me.
4625: 
4626: “I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a
4627: consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you
4628: shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like
4629: yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I
4630: have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”
4631: 
4632: “You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead
4633: of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I
4634: am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,
4635: would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I
4636: should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you
4637: could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
4638: work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him
4639: live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would
4640: bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
4641: But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
4642: union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will
4643: revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and
4644: chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
4645: inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor
4646: finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
4647: your birth.”
4648: 
4649: A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
4650: into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
4651: he calmed himself and proceeded—
4652: 
4653: “I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do
4654: not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt
4655: emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a
4656: hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the
4657: whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.
4658: What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of
4659: another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
4660: is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be
4661: monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more
4662: attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be
4663: harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me
4664: happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I
4665: excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
4666: request!”
4667: 
4668: I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
4669: of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
4670: His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
4671: of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion
4672: of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of
4673: feeling and continued,
4674: 
4675: “If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
4676: us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not
4677: that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
4678: acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will
4679: be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
4680: We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
4681: man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful
4682: and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
4683: wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,
4684: I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
4685: and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”
4686: 
4687: “You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of
4688: man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your
4689: only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,
4690: persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and
4691: you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,
4692: and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.
4693: This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”
4694: 
4695: “How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by
4696: my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
4697: I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that
4698: with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and
4699: dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions
4700: will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly
4701: away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”
4702: 
4703: His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and
4704: sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when
4705: I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my
4706: feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle
4707: these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I
4708: had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
4709: was yet in my power to bestow.
4710: 
4711: “You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not
4712: already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
4713: you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
4714: affording a wider scope for your revenge?”
4715: 
4716: “How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If
4717: I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
4718: the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall
4719: become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices
4720: are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
4721: necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel
4722: the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
4723: existence and events from which I am now excluded.”
4724: 
4725: I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various
4726: arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which
4727: he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight
4728: of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
4729: manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my
4730: calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers
4731: and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices
4732: was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a
4733: long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and
4734: my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.
4735: Turning to him, therefore, I said,
4736: 
4737: “I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,
4738: and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall
4739: deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”
4740: 
4741: “I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of
4742: heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my
4743: prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your
4744: home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with
4745: unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall
4746: appear.”
4747: 
4748: Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
4749: my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
4750: the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the
4751: sea of ice.
4752: 
4753: His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
4754: the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
4755: towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
4756: heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the
4757: little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced
4758: perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences
4759: of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the
4760: halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars
4761: shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
4762: rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
4763: ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
4764: thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I
4765: exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
4766: me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
4767: nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”
4768: 
4769: These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you
4770: how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I
4771: listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
4772: way to consume me.
4773: 
4774: Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no
4775: rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could
4776: give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a
4777: mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
4778: Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the
4779: family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I
4780: answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed
4781: under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if
4782: never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I
4783: loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate
4784: myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation
4785: made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,
4786: and that thought only had to me the reality of life.

4791: Chapter 18
4792: 
4793: 
4794: Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
4795: I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the
4796: vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
4797: repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not
4798: compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
4799: study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries
4800: having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
4801: material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
4802: father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
4803: every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
4804: undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
4805: me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
4806: hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
4807: unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My
4808: father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
4809: towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
4810: which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
4811: blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
4812: refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake
4813: alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
4814: rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and
4815: bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
4816: on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
4817: and a more cheerful heart.
4818: 
4819: It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
4820: calling me aside, thus addressed me,
4821: 
4822: “I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
4823: pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still
4824: unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in
4825: conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
4826: and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a
4827: point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”
4828: 
4829: I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—
4830: 
4831: “I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your
4832: marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
4833: stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your
4834: earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
4835: tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of
4836: man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
4837: entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
4838: wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another
4839: whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
4840: Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
4841: to feel.”
4842: 
4843: “My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and
4844: sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my
4845: warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are
4846: entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”
4847: 
4848: “The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,
4849: gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you
4850: feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
4851: a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
4852: strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
4853: therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
4854: marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
4855: from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You
4856: are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
4857: fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
4858: plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,
4859: however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
4860: your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words
4861: with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
4862: sincerity.”
4863: 
4864: I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
4865: of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
4866: thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me
4867: the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and
4868: dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
4869: and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
4870: impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
4871: with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
4872: ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
4873: his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
4874: which I expected peace.
4875: 
4876: I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
4877: England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
4878: of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
4879: use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining
4880: the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
4881: had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
4882: loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar
4883: intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful
4884: accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
4885: thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I
4886: should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
4887: harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
4888: unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus
4889: employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
4890: restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,
4891: the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
4892: accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
4893: slavery for ever.
4894: 
4895: These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to
4896: visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I
4897: clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I
4898: urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
4899: comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
4900: resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
4901: that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
4902: and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
4903: return, have restored me entirely to myself.
4904: 
4905: The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
4906: at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind
4907: precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without
4908: previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
4909: arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered
4910: with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
4911: commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
4912: an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many
4913: hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between
4914: me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times
4915: force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
4916: contemplate its progress?
4917: 
4918: To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union
4919: with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s
4920: age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one
4921: reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my
4922: unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
4923: enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and
4924: forget the past in my union with her.
4925: 
4926: I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
4927: which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should
4928: leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
4929: unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
4930: departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and
4931: would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in
4932: itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
4933: I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
4934: this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the
4935: slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
4936: the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
4937: would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
4938: machinations.
4939: 
4940: It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
4941: country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth
4942: therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
4943: my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had
4944: been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man
4945: is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s
4946: sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
4947: conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
4948: farewell.
4949: 
4950: I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
4951: knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.
4952: I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on
4953: it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
4954: me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
4955: and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could
4956: only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
4957: me whilst they endured.
4958: 
4959: After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
4960: many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
4961: Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He
4962: was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
4963: setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
4964: day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
4965: the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;
4966: “now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
4967: you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
4968: thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
4969: sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more
4970: amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
4971: eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a
4972: miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
4973: enjoyment.
4974: 
4975: We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to
4976: Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this
4977: voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
4978: We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
4979: Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz
4980: becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds
4981: between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
4982: many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
4983: black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,
4984: presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view
4985: rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
4986: the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
4987: flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
4988: and populous towns occupy the scene.
4989: 
4990: We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
4991: as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
4992: continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the
4993: bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
4994: drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
4995: were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
4996: been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
4997: man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes
4998: of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
4999: snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
5000: and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
5001: were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
5002: appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
5003: up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
5004: on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
5005: where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
5006: where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
5007: nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;
5008: but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
5009: mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
5010: charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
5011: Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
5012: island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
5013: that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
5014: half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
5015: and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
5016: pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
5017: our own country.”
5018: 
5019: Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and
5020: to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a
5021: being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and
5022: enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His
5023: soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
5024: devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
5025: in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
5026: satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard
5027: only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—
5028: 
5029:     ——The sounding cataract
5030:     Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
5031:     The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
5032:     Their colours and their forms, were then to him
5033:     An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
5034:     That had no need of a remoter charm,
5035:     By thought supplied, or any interest
5036:     Unborrow’d from the eye.
5037: 
5038:           [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]
5039: 
5040: And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost
5041: for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
5042: and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
5043: life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist
5044: in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
5045: beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
5046: consoles your unhappy friend.
5047: 
5048: Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
5049: tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,
5050: overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will
5051: proceed with my tale.
5052: 
5053: Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to
5054: post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
5055: the river was too gentle to aid us.
5056: 
5057: Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we
5058: arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
5059: It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw
5060: the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;
5061: they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
5062: remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish
5063: Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard
5064: of even in my country.
5065: 
5066: At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering
5067: above all, and the Tower famed in English history.

5073: 
5074: 
5075: London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
5076: months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the
5077: intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
5078: time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally
5079: occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
5080: completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
5081: introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most
5082: distinguished natural philosophers.
5083: 
5084: If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
5085: it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had
5086: come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of
5087: the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
5088: was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
5089: could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
5090: Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory
5091: peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
5092: my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
5093: fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
5094: Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
5095: my soul with anguish.
5096: 
5097: But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
5098: and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of
5099: manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
5100: instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long
5101: had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had
5102: in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
5103: taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
5104: European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the
5105: execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his
5106: enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this
5107: as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
5108: natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
5109: any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,
5110: alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also
5111: began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
5112: was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
5113: on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
5114: anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
5115: to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
5116: 
5117: After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in
5118: Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
5119: beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
5120: allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
5121: where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,
5122: although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
5123: all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.
5124: 
5125: We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
5126: February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
5127: north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not
5128: intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,
5129: Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
5130: this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and
5131: the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
5132: obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
5133: 
5134: We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at
5135: Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us
5136: mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
5137: stately deer were all novelties to us.
5138: 
5139: From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds
5140: were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
5141: there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles
5142: I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,
5143: after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
5144: Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his
5145: companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
5146: son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
5147: might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a
5148: dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these
5149: feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
5150: the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
5151: The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
5152: magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
5153: of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
5154: which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
5155: domes, embosomed among aged trees.
5156: 
5157: I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
5158: memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed
5159: for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never
5160: visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
5161: is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
5162: the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
5163: elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
5164: entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
5165: I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
5166: pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.
5167: 
5168: We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs
5169: and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
5170: animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery
5171: were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
5172: themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the
5173: field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated
5174: from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
5175: of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
5176: and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
5177: and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
5178: into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
5179: miserable self.
5180: 
5181: We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next
5182: place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village
5183: resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
5184: everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
5185: distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
5186: native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
5187: of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
5188: manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name
5189: made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit
5190: Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
5191: 
5192: From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
5193: Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the
5194: Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
5195: northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
5196: rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
5197: made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
5198: happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than
5199: mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
5200: in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
5201: imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
5202: inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among
5203: these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”
5204: 
5205: But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain
5206: amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and
5207: when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
5208: that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
5209: engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.
5210: 
5211: We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland
5212: and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
5213: of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
5214: to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my
5215: promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s
5216: disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance
5217: on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
5218: from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited
5219: for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
5220: miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I
5221: saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
5222: read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend
5223: followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
5224: When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
5225: but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
5226: his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
5227: consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed
5228: drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
5229: 
5230: I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
5231: have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well
5232: as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
5233: But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic
5234: castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s
5235: Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for
5236: the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was
5237: impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
5238: 
5239: We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and
5240: along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
5241: But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
5242: their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
5243: accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
5244: alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our
5245: rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
5246: my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
5247: time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
5248: congenial to your own temper.”
5249: 
5250: Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
5251: remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with
5252: you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch
5253: people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,
5254: that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
5255: your absence.”
5256: 
5257: Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
5258: Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the
5259: monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have
5260: finished, that he might receive his companion.
5261: 
5262: With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
5263: the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place
5264: fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
5265: continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
5266: affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
5267: inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
5268: gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they
5269: indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
5270: the mainland, which was about five miles distant.
5271: 
5272: On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
5273: these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two
5274: rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
5275: penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
5276: door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
5277: furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
5278: occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
5279: benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at
5280: and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
5281: which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
5282: of men.
5283: 
5284: In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
5285: when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to
5286: listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a
5287: monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was
5288: far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills
5289: are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
5290: plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
5291: troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
5292: infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.
5293: 
5294: In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but
5295: as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
5296: irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
5297: laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night
5298: in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in
5299: which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of
5300: enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
5301: mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
5302: were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in
5303: cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
5304: 
5305: Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
5306: a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
5307: the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I
5308: grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my
5309: persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
5310: to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much
5311: dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
5312: creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.
5313: 
5314: In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably
5315: advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
5316: hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was
5317: intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
5318: in my bosom.
5319: 
5320: 
5321: 
5322: 
5323: Chapter 20
5324: 
5325: 
5326: I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
5327: rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
5328: remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my
5329: labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
5330: to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to
5331: consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was
5332: engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
5333: barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest
5334: remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was
5335: alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
5336: mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
5337: sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
5338: had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
5339: reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
5340: creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
5341: loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
5342: for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn
5343: with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,
5344: and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
5345: deserted by one of his own species.
5346: 
5347: Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,
5348: yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon
5349: thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon
5350: the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a
5351: condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,
5352: to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved
5353: by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by
5354: his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
5355: promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
5356: as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at
5357: the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.
5358: 
5359: I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
5360: the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin
5361: wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
5362: which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
5363: had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
5364: and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
5365: fulfilment of my promise.
5366: 
5367: As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
5368: malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my
5369: promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
5370: tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me
5371: destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
5372: happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
5373: 
5374: I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
5375: heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I
5376: sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate
5377: the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
5378: terrible reveries.
5379: 
5380: Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;
5381: it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
5382: reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone
5383: specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
5384: of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
5385: although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
5386: was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
5387: person landed close to my house.
5388: 
5389: In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
5390: endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a
5391: presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
5392: dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation
5393: of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
5394: endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.
5395: 
5396: Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
5397: opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he
5398: approached me and said in a smothered voice,
5399: 
5400: “You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
5401: intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;
5402: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
5403: its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many
5404: months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have
5405: endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my
5406: hopes?”
5407: 
5408: “Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like
5409: yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”
5410: 
5411: “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
5412: unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe
5413: yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of
5414: day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;
5415: obey!”
5416: 
5417: “The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
5418: arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
5419: they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
5420: vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose
5421: delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your
5422: words will only exasperate my rage.”
5423: 
5424: The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
5425: impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a
5426: wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had
5427: feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
5428: Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,
5429: and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
5430: ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my
5431: wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge
5432: remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but
5433: first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
5434: misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with
5435: the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall
5436: repent of the injuries you inflict.”
5437: 
5438: “Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
5439: I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend
5440: beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”
5441: 
5442: “It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
5443: wedding-night.”
5444: 
5445: I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my
5446: death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”
5447: 
5448: I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
5449: precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot
5450: across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
5451: waves.
5452: 
5453: All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to
5454: pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I
5455: walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
5456: conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not
5457: followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him
5458: to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered
5459: to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
5460: And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on
5461: your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the
5462: fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and
5463: extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
5464: thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
5465: should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I
5466: had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall
5467: before my enemy without a bitter struggle.
5468: 
5469: The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
5470: calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
5471: the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last
5472: night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I
5473: almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
5474: creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I
5475: desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
5476: but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to
5477: be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
5478: dæmon whom I had myself created.
5479: 
5480: I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
5481: loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the
5482: sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
5483: sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
5484: were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep
5485: into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
5486: if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to
5487: reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
5488: words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
5489: like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.
5490: 
5491: The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
5492: appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
5493: fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
5494: it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to
5495: join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
5496: he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
5497: his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
5498: Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
5499: his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now
5500: conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
5501: my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to
5502: leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed
5503: southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
5504: I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.
5505: 
5506: Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered
5507: to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I
5508: must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must
5509: handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next
5510: morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
5511: of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
5512: destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had
5513: mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and
5514: then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments
5515: out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my
5516: work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly
5517: put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them
5518: up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
5519: meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
5520: chemical apparatus.
5521: 
5522: Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
5523: in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had
5524: before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
5525: whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film
5526: had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw
5527: clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
5528: to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not
5529: reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in
5530: my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made
5531: would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
5532: banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
5533: conclusion.
5534: 
5535: Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my
5536: basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
5537: The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
5538: but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a
5539: dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
5540: fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
5541: suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of
5542: darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound
5543: as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but
5544: the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
5545: rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
5546: that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
5547: direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
5548: moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its
5549: keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I
5550: slept soundly.
5551: 
5552: I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
5553: found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and
5554: the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found
5555: that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
5556: which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
5557: that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
5558: water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
5559: confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me
5560: and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
5561: world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the
5562: wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
5563: the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already
5564: been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
5565: my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
5566: that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the
5567: sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your
5568: task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
5569: of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
5570: sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so
5571: despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
5572: closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.
5573: 
5574: Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
5575: horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
5576: free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick
5577: and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high
5578: land towards the south.
5579: 
5580: Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured
5581: for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
5582: warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
5583: 
5584: How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
5585: of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a
5586: part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a
5587: wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived
5588: the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself
5589: suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I
5590: carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at
5591: length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of
5592: extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
5593: where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with
5594: me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good
5595: harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
5596: escape.
5597: 
5598: As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
5599: people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my
5600: appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
5601: together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
5602: a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
5603: spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My
5604: good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
5605: this town and inform me where I am?”
5606: 
5607: “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.
5608: “Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
5609: but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”
5610: 
5611: I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
5612: stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
5613: angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so
5614: roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to
5615: receive strangers so inhospitably.”
5616: 
5617: “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the
5618: English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”
5619: 
5620: While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly
5621: increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
5622: annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but
5623: no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
5624: crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
5625: approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must
5626: follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”
5627: 
5628: “Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not
5629: this a free country?”
5630: 
5631: “Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,
5632: and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
5633: found murdered here last night.”
5634: 
5635: This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;
5636: that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence
5637: and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from
5638: fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic
5639: to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
5640: apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that
5641: was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
5642: all fear of ignominy or death.
5643: 
5644: I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of
5645: the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
5646: recollection.
5647: 
5648: 
5649: 
5650: 
5651: Chapter 21
5652: 
5653: 
5654: I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
5655: benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,
5656: with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
5657: he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.
5658: 
5659: About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
5660: magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
5661: his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,
5662: they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
5663: for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
5664: not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
5665: two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
5666: and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding
5667: along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
5668: length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the
5669: light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
5670: who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the
5671: corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
5672: waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
5673: that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
5674: of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
5675: to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
5676: years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
5677: any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.
5678: 
5679: The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
5680: when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of
5681: my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
5682: mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
5683: support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
5684: an unfavourable augury from my manner.
5685: 
5686: The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was
5687: called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he
5688: saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
5689: and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same
5690: boat in which I had just landed.
5691: 
5692: A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door
5693: of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
5694: before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with
5695: only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse
5696: was afterwards found.
5697: 
5698: Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
5699: body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and
5700: rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
5701: quite gone.
5702: 
5703: Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
5704: that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
5705: was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been
5706: obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.
5707: Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body
5708: from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know
5709: the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
5710: of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.
5711: 
5712: Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into
5713: the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
5714: effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
5715: suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the
5716: murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
5717: and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the
5718: strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
5719: knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had
5720: inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly
5721: tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.
5722: 
5723: I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How
5724: can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with
5725: horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
5726: agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,
5727: passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry
5728: Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on
5729: the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you
5730: also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other
5731: victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my
5732: benefactor—”
5733: 
5734: The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and
5735: I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
5736: 
5737: A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my
5738: ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the
5739: murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
5740: attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was
5741: tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping
5742: my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke
5743: my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
5744: bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
5745: 
5746: Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not
5747: sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming
5748: children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
5749: youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
5750: next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I
5751: made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
5752: the wheel, continually renewed the torture?
5753: 
5754: But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
5755: a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
5756: gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
5757: It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had
5758: forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
5759: great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around
5760: and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I
5761: was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.
5762: 
5763: This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
5764: me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
5765: countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
5766: that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
5767: persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her
5768: tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,
5769: and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.
5770: 
5771: “Are you better now, sir?” said she.
5772: 
5773: I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;
5774: but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am
5775: still alive to feel this misery and horror.”
5776: 
5777: “For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the
5778: gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you
5779: were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none
5780: of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty
5781: with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”
5782: 
5783: I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
5784: speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt
5785: languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series
5786: of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it
5787: were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
5788: of reality.
5789: 
5790: As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
5791: feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
5792: me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The
5793: physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
5794: them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
5795: expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
5796: second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
5797: hangman who would gain his fee?
5798: 
5799: These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
5800: shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison
5801: to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
5802: had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to
5803: see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
5804: every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
5805: miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see
5806: that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
5807: intervals.
5808: 
5809: One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes
5810: half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom
5811: and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to
5812: remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I
5813: considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
5814: penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my
5815: thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.
5816: His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
5817: mine and addressed me in French,
5818: 
5819: “I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to
5820: make you more comfortable?”
5821: 
5822: “I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
5823: earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”
5824: 
5825: “I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
5826: one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I
5827: hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
5828: easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”
5829: 
5830: “That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become
5831: the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and
5832: have been, can death be any evil to me?”
5833: 
5834: “Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the
5835: strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some
5836: surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
5837: seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was
5838: presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
5839: unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
5840: your path.”
5841: 
5842: As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
5843: this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at
5844: the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some
5845: astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened
5846: to say,
5847: 
5848: “Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
5849: your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some
5850: trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune
5851: and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I
5852: discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote
5853: to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
5854: But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
5855: kind.”
5856: 
5857: “This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
5858: tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
5859: now to lament?”
5860: 
5861: “Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with
5862: gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”
5863: 
5864: I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
5865: instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
5866: misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for
5867: me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,
5868: and cried out in agony,
5869: 
5870: “Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not
5871: let him enter!”
5872: 
5873: Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help
5874: regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
5875: rather a severe tone,
5876: 
5877: “I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
5878: would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”
5879: 
5880: “My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
5881: from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how
5882: very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”
5883: 
5884: My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
5885: thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
5886: and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and
5887: quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.
5888: 
5889: Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
5890: arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,
5891: 
5892: “Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”
5893: 
5894: My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by
5895: dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
5896: desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of
5897: cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”
5898: said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance
5899: of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
5900: to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”
5901: 
5902: The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
5903: great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.
5904: 
5905: “Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the
5906: most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I
5907: should have died on the coffin of Henry.”
5908: 
5909: We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
5910: precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
5911: could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my
5912: strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the
5913: appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I
5914: gradually recovered my health.
5915: 
5916: As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
5917: melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was
5918: for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation
5919: into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
5920: relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
5921: life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now
5922: drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
5923: throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
5924: me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
5925: sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
5926: wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
5927: motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
5928: might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.
5929: 
5930: The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months
5931: in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a
5932: relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
5933: town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every
5934: care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared
5935: the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
5936: brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand
5937: jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney
5938: Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
5939: after my removal I was liberated from prison.
5940: 
5941: My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
5942: criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh
5943: atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not
5944: participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
5945: palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and
5946: although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I
5947: saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
5948: no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes
5949: they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark
5950: orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
5951: them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I
5952: first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.
5953: 
5954: My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked
5955: of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
5956: these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a
5957: wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
5958: cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more
5959: the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
5960: childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
5961: prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
5962: these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
5963: despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the
5964: existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
5965: to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.
5966: 
5967: Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
5968: triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should
5969: return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
5970: I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
5971: chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
5972: blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
5973: the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the
5974: mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to
5975: delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a
5976: journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My
5977: strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
5978: preyed upon my wasted frame.
5979: 
5980: Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
5981: my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel
5982: bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.
5983: It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
5984: the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my
5985: sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should
5986: soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
5987: yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
5988: shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
5989: that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest
5990: companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I
5991: repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
5992: with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
5993: Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
5994: to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in
5995: which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
5996: thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.
5997: 
5998: Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking
5999: every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
6000: only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of
6001: life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now
6002: swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did
6003: not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
6004: thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind
6005: of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free
6006: myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was
6007: watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
6008: were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of
6009: security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour
6010: and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
6011: forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
6012: susceptible.
6013: 
6014: 
6015: 
6016: 
6017: Chapter 22
6018: 
6019: 
6020: The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon
6021: found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I
6022: could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were
6023: indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
6024: sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to
6025: seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
6026: abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
6027: attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
6028: angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right
6029: to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose
6030: joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they
6031: would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
6032: my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!
6033: 
6034: My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
6035: various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I
6036: felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
6037: murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.
6038: 
6039: “Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. 
6040: Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such
6041: a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent
6042: as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
6043: of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all
6044: died by my hands.”
6045: 
6046: My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
6047: assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
6048: explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
6049: delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
6050: itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my
6051: convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
6052: concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be
6053: supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,
6054: besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
6055: hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
6056: his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
6057: silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
6058: Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably
6059: from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
6060: relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.
6061: 
6062: Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
6063: “My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat
6064: you never to make such an assertion again.”
6065: 
6066: “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who
6067: have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the
6068: assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
6069: A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
6070: saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
6071: sacrifice the whole human race.”
6072: 
6073: The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
6074: deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
6075: endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as
6076: possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
6077: Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
6078: misfortunes.
6079: 
6080: As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
6081: heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
6082: crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost
6083: self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
6084: sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
6085: were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
6086: to the sea of ice.
6087: 
6088: A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the
6089: following letter from Elizabeth:
6090: 
6091: “My dear Friend,
6092: 
6093: “It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
6094: dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may
6095: hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you
6096: must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than
6097: when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,
6098: tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in
6099: your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
6100: comfort and tranquillity.
6101: 
6102: “Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
6103: a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at
6104: this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
6105: conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
6106: some explanation necessary before we meet.
6107: 
6108: Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If
6109: you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
6110: But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet
6111: be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
6112: case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I
6113: have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.
6114: 
6115: “You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
6116: your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and
6117: taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
6118: place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I
6119: believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But
6120: as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
6121: other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
6122: case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
6123: happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?
6124: 
6125: “You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
6126: Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last
6127: autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
6128: creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our
6129: connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
6130: your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
6131: But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love
6132: you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
6133: friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
6134: own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
6135: miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now
6136: I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
6137: misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
6138: love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who
6139: have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
6140: tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured
6141: that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
6142: made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you
6143: obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
6144: will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.
6145: 
6146: “Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
6147: next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle
6148: will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your
6149: lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I
6150: shall need no other happiness.
6151: 
6152: “Elizabeth Lavenza.
6153: 
6154: 
6155: 
6156: “Geneva, May 18th, 17—”
6157: 
6158: 
6159: 
6160: This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
6161: the fiend—“_I will be with you on your
6162: wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
6163: dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
6164: happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he
6165: had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
6166: deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
6167: victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he
6168: were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the
6169: peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
6170: cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
6171: penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my
6172: Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
6173: remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.
6174: 
6175: Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some
6176: softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
6177: dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
6178: angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make
6179: her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
6180: again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My
6181: destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
6182: should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
6183: surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
6184: _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
6185: threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
6186: he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
6187: after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my
6188: immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
6189: father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life
6190: should not retard it a single hour.
6191: 
6192: In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and
6193: affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness
6194: remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in
6195: you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life
6196: and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
6197: dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
6198: horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
6199: wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of
6200: misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
6201: for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But
6202: until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most
6203: earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”
6204: 
6205: In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned
6206: to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
6207: in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a
6208: change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
6209: vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
6210: compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I
6211: was.
6212: 
6213: The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness
6214: with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed
6215: me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
6216: despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
6217: bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.
6218: 
6219: Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
6220: would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
6221: feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason
6222: returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
6223: resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
6224: guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
6225: otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
6226: 
6227: Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
6228: Elizabeth. I remained silent.
6229: 
6230: “Have you, then, some other attachment?”
6231: 
6232: “None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with
6233: delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate
6234: myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”
6235: 
6236: “My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen
6237: us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
6238: for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be
6239: small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
6240: And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
6241: care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
6242: deprived.”
6243: 
6244: Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the
6245: threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
6246: yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
6247: invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with
6248: you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as
6249: unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were
6250: balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
6251: countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
6252: ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,
6253: the seal to my fate.
6254: 
6255: Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
6256: intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself
6257: for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
6258: the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if
6259: possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
6260: intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I
6261: hastened that of a far dearer victim.
6262: 
6263: As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or
6264: a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my
6265: feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
6266: countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
6267: eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
6268: not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
6269: that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
6270: into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.
6271: 
6272: Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,
6273: and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own
6274: heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness
6275: into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the
6276: decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of
6277: the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian
6278: government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It
6279: was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa
6280: Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake
6281: near which it stood.
6282: 
6283: In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
6284: fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
6285: constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
6286: by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the
6287: period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
6288: regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for
6289: in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
6290: for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of
6291: as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.
6292: 
6293: Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
6294: calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
6295: destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
6296: and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had
6297: promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the
6298: meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in
6299: the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
6300: 
6301: After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
6302: father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our
6303: journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our
6304: voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;
6305: all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.
6306: 
6307: Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the
6308: feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
6309: were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
6310: beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
6311: Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,
6312: surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy
6313: mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
6314: opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
6315: ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
6316: insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.
6317: 
6318: I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If
6319: you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would
6320: endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
6321: one day at least permits me to enjoy.”
6322: 
6323: “Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,
6324: nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
6325: painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
6326: not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I
6327: will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
6328: along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
6329: above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
6330: interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
6331: the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
6332: the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature
6333: appears!”
6334: 
6335: Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
6336: reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;
6337: joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
6338: to distraction and reverie.
6339: 
6340: The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and
6341: observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
6342: lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
6343: the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The
6344: spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
6345: of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.
6346: 
6347: The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
6348: sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
6349: and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
6350: shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
6351: hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched
6352: the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
6353: me and cling to me for ever.
6354: 
6355: 
6356: 
6357: 
6358: Chapter 23
6359: 
6360: 
6361: It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
6362: shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
6363: contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
6364: in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.
6365: 
6366: The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
6367: in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
6368: beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
6369: flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
6370: scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
6371: that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
6372: 
6373: I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
6374: shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious
6375: and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
6376: my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my
6377: life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
6378: of my adversary was extinguished.
6379: 
6380: Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
6381: but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and
6382: trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
6383: What is it you fear?”
6384: 
6385: “Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and
6386: all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”
6387: 
6388: I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how
6389: fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,
6390: and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
6391: until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.
6392: 
6393: She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages
6394: of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
6395: my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
6396: conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
6397: execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
6398: scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I
6399: heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
6400: motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
6401: trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This
6402: state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
6403: into the room.
6404: 
6405: Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the
6406: destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was
6407: there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
6408: and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I
6409: turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
6410: by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!
6411: Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment
6412: only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
6413: 
6414: When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
6415: countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
6416: appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I
6417: escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my
6418: wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the
6419: posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
6420: her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have
6421: supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
6422: the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held
6423: in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.
6424: The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the
6425: breath had ceased to issue from her lips.
6426: 
6427: While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.
6428: The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of
6429: panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
6430: The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
6431: described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
6432: A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
6433: fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards
6434: the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
6435: leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
6436: plunged into the lake.
6437: 
6438: The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to
6439: the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
6440: boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we
6441: returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
6442: form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to
6443: search the country, parties going in different directions among the
6444: woods and vines.
6445: 
6446: I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
6447: house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
6448: man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
6449: eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I
6450: was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
6451: happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
6452: I had lost.
6453: 
6454: After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
6455: where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I
6456: hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
6457: distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
6458: various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
6459: cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death
6460: of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
6461: of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
6462: friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
6463: might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his
6464: feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started
6465: up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
6466: 
6467: There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the
6468: wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was
6469: hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men
6470: to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from
6471: mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,
6472: and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
6473: exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
6474: to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
6475: familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day
6476: before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
6477: Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw
6478: the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
6479: then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
6480: a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
6481: but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had
6482: snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
6483: so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
6484: man.
6485: 
6486: But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
6487: overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their
6488: _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know
6489: that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My
6490: own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of
6491: my hideous narration.
6492: 
6493: I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
6494: under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old
6495: man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
6496: delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
6497: all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
6498: few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed
6499: be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
6500: in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
6501: around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
6502: rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.
6503: 
6504: What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and
6505: darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,
6506: indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
6507: with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a
6508: dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear
6509: conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
6510: prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I
6511: understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.
6512: 
6513: Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I
6514: awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the
6515: memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their
6516: cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had
6517: sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a
6518: maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
6519: that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
6520: revenge on his cursed head.
6521: 
6522: Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
6523: reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
6524: a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town
6525: and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the
6526: destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole
6527: authority for the apprehension of the murderer.
6528: 
6529: The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be
6530: assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall
6531: be spared to discover the villain.”
6532: 
6533: “I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the
6534: deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I
6535: should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth
6536: which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to
6537: be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My
6538: manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my
6539: own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
6540: quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related
6541: my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
6542: accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.
6543: 
6544: The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued
6545: he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with
6546: horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
6547: on his countenance.
6548: 
6549: When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I
6550: accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your
6551: whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that
6552: your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
6553: functions on this occasion.”
6554: 
6555: This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
6556: auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
6557: to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
6558: to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
6559: returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you
6560: every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
6561: have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an
6562: animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
6563: no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
6564: the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
6565: has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”
6566: 
6567: “I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if
6568: he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
6569: and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not
6570: credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
6571: punishment which is his desert.”
6572: 
6573: As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
6574: “You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if
6575: it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
6576: punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have
6577: yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
6578: impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
6579: make up your mind to disappointment.”
6580: 
6581: “That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My
6582: revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I
6583: confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage
6584: is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
6585: loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have
6586: but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to
6587: his destruction.”
6588: 
6589: I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy
6590: in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
6591: which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
6592: magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
6593: devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
6594: madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
6595: reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.
6596: 
6597: “Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
6598: wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”
6599: 
6600: I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
6601: some other mode of action.
6602: 
6603: 
6604: 
6605: 
6606: Chapter 24
6607: 
6608: 
6609: My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
6610: swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
6611: endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
6612: allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
6613: delirium or death would have been my portion.
6614: 
6615: My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I
6616: was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
6617: hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
6618: which had belonged to my mother, and departed.
6619: 
6620: And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have
6621: traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships
6622: which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I
6623: have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon
6624: the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared
6625: not die and leave my adversary in being.
6626: 
6627: When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I
6628: might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,
6629: and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
6630: what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the
6631: entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
6632: reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
6633: graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
6634: were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
6635: scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
6636: observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
6637: cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
6638: mourner.
6639: 
6640: The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
6641: rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,
6642: and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass
6643: and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the
6644: sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
6645: deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the
6646: spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,
6647: until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will
6648: preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun
6649: and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
6650: eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
6651: ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed
6652: and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
6653: torments me.”
6654: 
6655: I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
6656: that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but
6657: the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.
6658: 
6659: I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
6660: laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
6661: it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
6662: Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have
6663: destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I
6664: was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known
6665: and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
6666: audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have
6667: determined to live, and I am satisfied.”
6668: 
6669: I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
6670: eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
6671: full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
6672: mortal speed.
6673: 
6674: I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a
6675: slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The
6676: blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend
6677: enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I
6678: took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.
6679: 
6680: Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
6681: have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by
6682: this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
6683: who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
6684: left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw
6685: the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering
6686: on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
6687: what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the
6688: least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil
6689: and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
6690: followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
6691: extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,
6692: when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
6693: was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The
6694: fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
6695: I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
6696: invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
6697: I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
6698: few drops that revived me, and vanish.
6699: 
6700: I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon
6701: generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
6702: country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom
6703: seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
6704: path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
6705: by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,
6706: which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had
6707: provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
6708: 
6709: My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
6710: sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most
6711: miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The
6712: spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
6713: happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
6714: this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was
6715: sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
6716: friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
6717: countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s
6718: voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by
6719: a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
6720: come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
6721: friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to
6722: their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
6723: persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that
6724: burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the
6725: destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
6726: mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
6727: ardent desire of my soul.
6728: 
6729: What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he
6730: left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
6731: me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet
6732: over”—these words were legible in one of these
6733: inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I
6734: seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
6735: cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if
6736: you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my
6737: enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
6738: hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”
6739: 
6740: Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,
6741: miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search
6742: until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my
6743: Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
6744: reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!
6745: 
6746: As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the
6747: cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were
6748: shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
6749: seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to
6750: seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
6751: procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
6752: 
6753: The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One
6754: inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils
6755: only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
6756: upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
6757: hatred.”
6758: 
6759: My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
6760: resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support
6761: me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
6762: until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
6763: of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
6764: south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
6765: its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when
6766: they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with
6767: rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down
6768: and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
6769: safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,
6770: to meet and grapple with him.
6771: 
6772: Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
6773: traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the
6774: fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had
6775: daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
6776: when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and
6777: I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new
6778: courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
6779: hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
6780: fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,
6781: had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
6782: putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
6783: his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter
6784: food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
6785: numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
6786: night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
6787: journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
6788: conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
6789: ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.
6790: 
6791: On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
6792: He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless
6793: journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
6794: of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a
6795: genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea
6796: that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
6797: returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
6798: After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
6799: round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.
6800: 
6801: I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
6802: the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
6803: departed from land.
6804: 
6805: I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured
6806: misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
6807: burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and
6808: rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard
6809: the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But
6810: again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
6811: 
6812: By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that
6813: I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
6814: of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
6815: despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured
6816: her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after
6817: the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
6818: summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
6819: died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
6820: caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to
6821: discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
6822: distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
6823: form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
6824: Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
6825: not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was
6826: dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
6827: oppressed me, I wept aloud.
6828: 
6829: But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their
6830: dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
6831: hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
6832: irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor
6833: did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
6834: time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed
6835: perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I
6836: beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
6837: me.
6838: 
6839: But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
6840: suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had
6841: ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
6842: the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous
6843: and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;
6844: and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
6845: tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few
6846: minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left
6847: drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and
6848: thus preparing for me a hideous death.
6849: 
6850: In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I
6851: myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your
6852: vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
6853: I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
6854: at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
6855: by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
6856: the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,
6857: still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
6858: purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
6859: my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my
6860: vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied
6861: hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.
6862: 
6863: Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow
6864: me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,
6865: swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
6866: and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to
6867: undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
6868: No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if
6869: the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
6870: shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
6871: woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent
6872: and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
6873: trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
6874: and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,
6875: Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
6876: thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the
6877: steel aright.
6878: 
6879: Walton, _in continuation._
6880: 
6881: 
6882: August 26th, 17—.
6883: 
6884: 
6885: You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not
6886: feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
6887: mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
6888: tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
6889: difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes
6890: were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
6891: and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his
6892: countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
6893: tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
6894: volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
6895: of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.
6896: 
6897: His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,
6898: yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
6899: and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
6900: greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
6901: however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!
6902: I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
6903: endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his
6904: creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.
6905: 
6906: “Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your
6907: senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the
6908: world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek
6909: to increase your own.”
6910: 
6911: Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked
6912: to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,
6913: but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
6914: with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said
6915: he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
6916: posterity.”
6917: 
6918: Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
6919: tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my
6920: soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
6921: and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe
6922: him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
6923: every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can
6924: now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
6925: death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
6926: delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
6927: friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
6928: excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
6929: fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
6930: remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
6931: them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.
6932: 
6933: Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
6934: misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays
6935: unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His
6936: eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates
6937: a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
6938: without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days
6939: of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems
6940: to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.
6941: 
6942: “When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for
6943: some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness
6944: of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
6945: the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
6946: for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
6947: might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had
6948: completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
6949: animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But
6950: this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
6951: serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes
6952: are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
6953: chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
6954: analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
6955: conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot
6956: recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod
6957: heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
6958: of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
6959: ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once
6960: was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency
6961: rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
6962: never, never again to rise.”
6963: 
6964: Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have
6965: sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert
6966: seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his
6967: value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.
6968: 
6969: “I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so
6970: miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
6971: affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any
6972: man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
6973: where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
6974: the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
6975: minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our
6976: infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
6977: are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
6978: certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a
6979: brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
6980: suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
6981: however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
6982: contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
6983: through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
6984: I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
6985: Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
6986: feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
6987: were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
6988: utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But
6989: such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
6990: gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”
6991: 
6992: My beloved Sister,
6993: 
6994: September 2d.
6995: 
6996: 
6997: I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
6998: doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
6999: it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
7000: threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I
7001: have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
7002: none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our
7003: situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is
7004: terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
7005: through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.
7006: 
7007: And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my
7008: destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and
7009: you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My
7010: beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
7011: in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband
7012: and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!
7013: 
7014: My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He
7015: endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
7016: which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have
7017: happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
7018: of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel
7019: the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
7020: rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
7021: vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
7022: resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
7023: expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
7024: caused by this despair.
7025: 
7026: September 5th.
7027: 
7028: 
7029: A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
7030: highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
7031: forbear recording it.
7032: 
7033: We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
7034: of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of
7035: my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
7036: desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
7037: still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
7038: roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
7039: lifelessness.
7040: 
7041: I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
7042: This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his
7043: eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half
7044: a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They
7045: entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his
7046: companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
7047: to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
7048: We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
7049: feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
7050: passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
7051: lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
7052: this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn
7053: promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my
7054: course southwards.
7055: 
7056: This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived
7057: the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in
7058: possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when
7059: Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
7060: to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
7061: and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,
7062: he said,
7063: 
7064: “What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,
7065: so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious
7066: expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was
7067: smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
7068: terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
7069: and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
7070: these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this
7071: was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the
7072: benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
7073: who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,
7074: behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
7075: mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
7076: to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
7077: peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
7078: firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
7079: thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
7080: yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
7081: purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your
7082: hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
7083: shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
7084: marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
7085: who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”
7086: 
7087: He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed
7088: in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
7089: you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were
7090: unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had
7091: been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
7092: desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage
7093: would return.
7094: 
7095: They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
7096: almost deprived of life.
7097: 
7098: How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than
7099: return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my
7100: fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
7101: willingly continue to endure their present hardships.
7102: 
7103: September 7th.
7104: 
7105: 
7106: The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
7107: Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back
7108: ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess
7109: to bear this injustice with patience.
7110: 
7111: September 12th.
7112: 
7113: 
7114: It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility
7115: and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these
7116: bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted
7117: towards England and towards you, I will not despond.
7118: 
7119: September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
7120: at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
7121: in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
7122: attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
7123: such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked
7124: behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
7125: the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
7126: free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
7127: country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
7128: loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
7129: cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they
7130: will soon return to England.”
7131: 
7132: “Do you, then, really return?”
7133: 
7134: “Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them
7135: unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”
7136: 
7137: “Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but
7138: mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but
7139: surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
7140: sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
7141: bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.
7142: 
7143: It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was
7144: entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
7145: difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing
7146: draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he
7147: told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
7148: 
7149: His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat
7150: by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but
7151: presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
7152: said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
7153: soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think
7154: not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning
7155: hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself
7156: justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I
7157: have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
7158: In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was
7159: bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
7160: well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
7161: that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
7162: my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
7163: misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
7164: create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity
7165: and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
7166: beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
7167: know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may
7168: render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was
7169: mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I
7170: asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,
7171: when I am only induced by reason and virtue.
7172: 
7173: “Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
7174: this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have
7175: little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these
7176: points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I
7177: leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
7178: approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I
7179: may still be misled by passion.
7180: 
7181: “That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
7182: other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
7183: only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of
7184: the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,
7185: Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
7186: be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
7187: science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been
7188: blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”
7189: 
7190: His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
7191: effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he
7192: attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
7193: his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
7194: away from his lips.
7195: 
7196: Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this
7197: glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the
7198: depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and
7199: feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
7200: disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find
7201: consolation.
7202: 
7203: I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the
7204: breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there
7205: is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
7206: where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.
7207: Good night, my sister.
7208: 
7209: Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
7210: remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
7211: it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this
7212: final and wonderful catastrophe.
7213: 
7214: I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
7215: friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to
7216: describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
7217: proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
7218: locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
7219: apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
7220: approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
7221: towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
7222: such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
7223: endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
7224: I called on him to stay.
7225: 
7226: He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
7227: lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
7228: every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
7229: uncontrollable passion.
7230: 
7231: “That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my
7232: crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
7233: close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it
7234: avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee
7235: by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer
7236: me.”
7237: 
7238: His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
7239: me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
7240: enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
7241: approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his
7242: face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
7243: attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster
7244: continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I
7245: gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
7246: 
7247: “Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you
7248: had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
7249: before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
7250: Frankenstein would yet have lived.”
7251: 
7252: “And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then
7253: dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,
7254: “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the
7255: ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
7256: lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me
7257: on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the
7258: groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be
7259: susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
7260: and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
7261: torture such as you cannot even imagine.
7262: 
7263: “After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
7264: and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
7265: abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
7266: my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
7267: happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
7268: he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
7269: indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
7270: indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I
7271: recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I
7272: knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
7273: slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
7274: disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had
7275: cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
7276: despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no
7277: choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
7278: chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
7279: passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”
7280: 
7281: I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called
7282: to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
7283: persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
7284: friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.
7285: “It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
7286: have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
7287: consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
7288: If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
7289: he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you
7290: feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
7291: from your power.”
7292: 
7293: “Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.
7294: “Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
7295: be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
7296: No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of
7297: virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
7298: overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has
7299: become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
7300: bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
7301: content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
7302: well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once
7303: my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
7304: I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
7305: love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was
7306: nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
7307: degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no
7308: malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the
7309: frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
7310: creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
7311: visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
7312: fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
7313: had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.
7314: 
7315: “You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
7316: crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them
7317: he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured
7318: wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
7319: not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still
7320: I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no
7321: injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all
7322: humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
7323: friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic
7324: who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
7325: and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
7326: abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
7327: blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
7328: 
7329: “But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and
7330: the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
7331: death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have
7332: devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
7333: admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
7334: irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but
7335: your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the
7336: hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
7337: imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
7338: will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.
7339: 
7340: “Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work
7341: is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to
7342: consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
7343: but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
7344: sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
7345: thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall
7346: collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
7347: remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
7348: create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the
7349: agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
7350: unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
7351: more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no
7352: longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,
7353: feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
7354: happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
7355: opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
7356: rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
7357: me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by
7358: crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
7359: death?
7360: 
7361: “Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
7362: eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
7363: and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
7364: satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
7365: didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
7366: and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
7367: and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
7368: that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
7369: thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
7370: wounds until death shall close them for ever.
7371: 
7372: “But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I
7373: shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning
7374: miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
7375: exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration
7376: will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit
7377: will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
7378: Farewell.”
7379: 
7380: He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
7381: which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and
7382: lost in darkness and distance.

7658: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
7659: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
7660: Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
7661: and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
7662: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
7663: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

7681: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
7682: Literary Archive Foundation
7683: 
7684: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
7685: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
7686: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
7687: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
7688: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
7689: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
7690: status with the IRS.
7691: 
7692: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
7693: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
7694: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
7695: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
7696: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
7697: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
7698: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
7699: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
7700: 
7701: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
7702: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
7703: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
7704: approach us with offers to donate.
7705: 
7706: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
7707: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
7708: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
7709: 
7710: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
7711: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
7712: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
7713: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

7715: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
7716: 
7717: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
7718: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
7719: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
7720: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
7721: volunteer support.
7722: 
7723: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
7724: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
7725: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
7726: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
7727: edition.
7728: 
7729: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
7730: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
7731: 
7732: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
7733: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
7734: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
7735: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
