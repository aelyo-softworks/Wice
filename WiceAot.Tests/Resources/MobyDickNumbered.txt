00339:   (Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School.)
00340: 
00341:   The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
00342:   now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
00343:   handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
00344:   known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it
00345:   somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
00346: 
00347:   “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
00348:   name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through
00349:   ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the
00350:   signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.”
00351:   —_Hackluyt._
00352: 
00353:   “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. _hval_. This animal is named from
00354:   roundness or rolling; for in Dan. _hvalt_ is arched or vaulted.”
00355:   —_Webster’s Dictionary._
00356: 
00357:   “WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. _Wallen_;
00358:   A.S. _Walw-ian_, to roll, to wallow.” —_Richardson’s Dictionary._

00377: 
00378: 
00379: 
00380:   It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
00381:   a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
00382:   Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
00383:   allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
00384:   sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
00385:   take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
00386:   these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As
00387:   touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
00388:   appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
00389:   affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously
00390:   said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and
00391:   generations, including our own.
00392: 
00393:   So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
00394:   Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
00395:   world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
00396:   rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
00397:   poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
00398:   bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
00399:   unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more
00400:   pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
00401:   ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the
00402:   Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
00403:   royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
00404:   are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
00405:   long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
00406:   Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike
00407:   unsplinterable glasses!

00425:   —_Isaiah_.
00426: 
00427:   “And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this

00429:   incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the
00430:   bottomless gulf of his paunch.” —_Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals_.

00435: 
00436:   “Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a
00437:   great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the
00438:   former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,
00439:   open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea
00440:   before him into a foam.” —_Tooke’s Lucian_. “_The True History_.”

00446:   which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he
00447:   brought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own
00448:   country, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He
00449:   said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.”

00454:   enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are
00455:   immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in

00467: 
00468:   “Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have received

00854: my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
00855: principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
00856: methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
00857: get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
00858: With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
00859: quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they
00860: but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
00861: cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
00862: 
00863: There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
00864: wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her
00865: surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
00866: downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
00867: cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
00868: land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
00869: 
00870: Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
00871: Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What
00872: do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
00873: thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
00874: leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some
00875: looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
00876: rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these
00877: are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to
00878: counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are
00879: the green fields gone? What do they here?
00880: 
00881: But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
00882: seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
00883: extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
00884: warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water
00885: as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
00886: them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
00887: and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell
00888: me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
00889: those ships attract them thither?
00890: 
00891: Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
00892: almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
00893: dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in
00894: it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
00895: reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
00896: infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
00897: Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this
00898: experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
00899: professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
00900: ever.
00901: 
00902: But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
00903: quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley
00904: of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his
00905: trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were
00906: within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up
00907: from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands
00908: winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
00909: their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and
00910: though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
00911: shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were
00912: fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,
00913: when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among
00914: Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop
00915: of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel
00916: your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon
00917: suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy
00918: him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian
00919: trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
00920: robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
00921: Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a
00922: mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
00923: of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did
00924: the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely
00925: all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that
00926: story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
00927: image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that
00928: same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image
00929: of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
00930: 
00931: Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
00932: to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my
00933: lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a
00934: passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a
00935: purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers
00936: get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy
00937: themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;
00938: nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
00939: Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction
00940: of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all
00941: honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
00942: whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
00943: without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
00944: And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory
00945: in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I
00946: never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously
00947: buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
00948: will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
00949: fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
00950: Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
00951: mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.
00952: 
00953: No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
00954: plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
00955: True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
00956: spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of
00957: thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,
00958: particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
00959: Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if
00960: just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
00961: lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
00962: awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
00963: schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
00964: the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off
00965: in time.
00966: 
00967: What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
00968: and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
00969: I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
00970: Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
00971: respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t
00972: a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may
00973: order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
00974: satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
00975: one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or
00976: metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
00977: passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,
00978: and be content.
00979: 
00980: Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
00981: paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
00982: penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must
00983: pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and
00984: being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
00985: infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being
00986: paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man
00987: receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
00988: believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no
00989: account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign
00990: ourselves to perdition!
00991: 
00992: Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
00993: exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,
00994: head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
00995: you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
00996: Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
00997: the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not
00998: so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
00999: other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But
01000: wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
01001: merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
01002: voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the
01003: constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in
01004: some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,
01005: doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
01006: programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in
01007: as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
01008: performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
01009: something like this:
01010: 
01011: “_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._
01012: “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”
01013: 
01014: Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
01015: Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
01016: others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short
01017: and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I
01018: cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the
01019: circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives
01020: which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
01021: me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the
01022: delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
01023: and discriminating judgment.
01024: 
01025: Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
01026: himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
01027: curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
01028: bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all
01029: the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,
01030: helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things
01031: would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an
01032: everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and
01033: land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to
01034: perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let
01035: me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of
01036: the place one lodges in.
01037: 
01038: By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
01039: great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
01040: conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
01041: my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
01042: all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
01043: 
01044: 
01045: CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.
01046: 
01047: I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
01048: arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city
01049: of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night
01050: in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little
01051: packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
01052: that place would offer, till the following Monday.
01053: 
01054: As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
01055: this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
01056: be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was
01057: made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a
01058: fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
01059: old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has
01060: of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
01061: in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket
01062: was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the
01063: first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket
01064: did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes
01065: to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did
01066: that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
01067: imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in
01068: order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
01069: bowsprit?
01070: 
01071: Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
01072: in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a
01073: matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a
01074: very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
01075: and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had
01076: sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
01077: wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of
01078: a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
01079: north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you
01080: may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to
01081: inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.
01082: 
01083: With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The
01084: Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further
01085: on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came
01086: such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
01087: ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay
01088: ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
01089: when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from
01090: hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
01091: miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one
01092: moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of
01093: the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t
01094: you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are
01095: stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets
01096: that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not
01097: the cheeriest inns.
01098: 
01099: Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
01100: and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At
01101: this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
01102: the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light
01103: proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood
01104: invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the
01105: uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble
01106: over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying
01107: particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,
01108: Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then
01109: must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and
01110: hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
01111: door.
01112: 
01113: It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
01114: faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
01115: Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
01116: preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping
01117: and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing
01118: out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’
01119: 
01120: Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
01121: docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
01122: swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
01123: representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
01124: underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”
01125: 
01126: Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought
01127: I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this
01128: Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
01129: the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated
01130: little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here
01131: from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
01132: poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
01133: spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
01134: 
01135: It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
01136: as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
01137: where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
01138: ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
01139: is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the
01140: hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind
01141: called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
01142: only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
01143: lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
01144: outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where
01145: the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only
01146: glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my
01147: mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are
01148: windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t
01149: stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint
01150: here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The
01151: universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted
01152: off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth
01153: against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with
01154: his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a
01155: corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the
01156: tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken
01157: wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty
01158: night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their
01159: oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
01160: privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
01161: 
01162: But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
01163: to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra
01164: than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
01165: line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in
01166: order to keep out this frost?
01167: 
01168: Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
01169: door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
01170: moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a
01171: Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
01172: temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
01173: 
01174: But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
01175: is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted
01176: feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.
01177: 
01178: 
01179: CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
01180: 
01181: Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
01182: low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
01183: the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
01184: oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
01185: unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
01186: study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of
01187: the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
01188: purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
01189: you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
01190: England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint
01191: of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
01192: especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
01193: entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however
01194: wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.
01195: 
01196: But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
01197: portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
01198: picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
01199: nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive
01200: a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
01201: half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
01202: it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what
01203: that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,
01204: deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight
01205: gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a
01206: blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of
01207: the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to
01208: that one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found
01209: out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint
01210: resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?
01211: 
01212: In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
01213: partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
01214: whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner
01215: in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its
01216: three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,
01217: purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of
01218: impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
01219: 
01220: The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
01221: array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with
01222: glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
01223: of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
01224: round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
01225: mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal
01226: and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,
01227: horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances
01228: and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With
01229: this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan
01230: Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that
01231: harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away
01232: with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The
01233: original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle
01234: sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last
01235: was found imbedded in the hump.
01236: 
01237: Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut
01238: through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
01239: fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place
01240: is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
01241: planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
01242: cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
01243: old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
01244: table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
01245: gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
01246: further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude
01247: attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
01248: vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost
01249: drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old
01250: decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,
01251: like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),
01252: bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells
01253: the sailors deliriums and death.
01254: 
01255: Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
01256: cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
01257: deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
01258: rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
01259: _this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;
01260: and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp
01261: down for a shilling.
01262: 
01263: Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about
01264: a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I
01265: sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with
01266: a room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed
01267: unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no
01268: objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are
01269: goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”
01270: 
01271: I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
01272: ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that
01273: if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
01274: harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
01275: further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with
01276: the half of any decent man’s blanket.
01277: 
01278: “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
01279: Supper’ll be ready directly.”
01280: 
01281: I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
01282: Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
01283: his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
01284: between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but
01285: he didn’t make much headway, I thought.
01286: 
01287: At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
01288: adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said
01289: he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
01290: winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold
01291: to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the
01292: fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
01293: dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a
01294: green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
01295: manner.
01296: 
01297: “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
01298: sartainty.”
01299: 
01300: “Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
01301: 
01302: “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the
01303: harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he
01304: don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
01305: 
01306: “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
01307: 
01308: “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.
01309: 
01310: I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
01311: complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
01312: turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
01313: bed before I did.
01314: 
01315: Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
01316: what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
01317: evening as a looker on.
01318: 
01319: Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
01320: cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing
01321: this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now
01322: we’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”
01323: 
01324: A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
01325: open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their
01326: shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,
01327: all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they
01328: seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from
01329: their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,
01330: that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the
01331: wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out
01332: brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon
01333: which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he
01334: swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never
01335: mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,
01336: or on the weather side of an ice-island.
01337: 
01338: The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
01339: with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
01340: capering about most obstreperously.
01341: 
01342: I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
01343: he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
01344: own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
01345: noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the
01346: sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though
01347: but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I
01348: will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six
01349: feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I
01350: have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and
01351: burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the
01352: deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem
01353: to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a
01354: Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of
01355: those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When
01356: the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man
01357: slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my
01358: comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his
01359: shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with
01360: them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s
01361: Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
01362: 
01363: It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost
01364: supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself
01365: upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the
01366: entrance of the seamen.
01367: 
01368: No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
01369: rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but
01370: people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to
01371: sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,
01372: and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely
01373: multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should
01374: sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep
01375: two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all
01376: sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
01377: cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
01378: 
01379: The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
01380: thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
01381: harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
01382: the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
01383: Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
01384: and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
01385: midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
01386: 
01387: “Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep
01388: with him. I’ll try the bench here.”
01389: 
01390: “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
01391: mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and
01392: notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
01393: there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying
01394: he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
01395: the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
01396: like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
01397: plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was
01398: near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
01399: bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing
01400: in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
01401: shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
01402: the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
01403: brown study.
01404: 
01405: I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
01406: short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
01407: narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
01408: than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the
01409: first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
01410: leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I
01411: soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from
01412: under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,
01413: especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from
01414: the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in
01415: the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the
01416: night.
01417: 
01418: The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal
01419: a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
01420: wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
01421: second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
01422: morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
01423: standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
01424: 
01425: Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
01426: spending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began
01427: to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
01428: against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be
01429: dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps
01430: we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.
01431: 
01432: But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
01433: and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
01434: 
01435: “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such
01436: late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.
01437: 
01438: The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
01439: mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he
01440: answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to
01441: rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out
01442: a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,
01443: unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”
01444: 
01445: “Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are
01446: telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
01447: landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
01448: Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
01449: this town?”
01450: 
01451: “That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t
01452: sell it here, the market’s overstocked.”
01453: 
01454: “With what?” shouted I.
01455: 
01456: “With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”
01457: 
01458: “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better
01459: stop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
01460: 
01461: “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I
01462: rayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a
01463: slanderin’ his head.”
01464: 
01465: “I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at
01466: this unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.
01467: 
01468: “It’s broke a’ready,” said he.
01469: 
01470: “Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”
01471: 
01472: “Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”
01473: 
01474: “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
01475: snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one
01476: another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a
01477: bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
01478: belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have
01479: not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
01480: exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
01481: towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,
01482: landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
01483: degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
01484: harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the
01485: night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay
01486: that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good
01487: evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of
01488: sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,
01489: sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render
01490: yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
01491: 
01492: “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
01493: sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be
01494: easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived
01495: from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand
01496: heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and
01497: that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it
01498: would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is
01499: goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as
01500: he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for
01501: all the airth like a string of inions.”
01502: 
01503: This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
01504: that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the
01505: same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
01506: Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
01507: business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
01508: 
01509: “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
01510: 
01511: “He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
01512: late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
01513: slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
01514: for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
01515: afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the
01516: foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
01517: somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
01518: Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a
01519: glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
01520: me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a
01521: clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that
01522: harpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;
01523: _do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”
01524: 
01525: I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
01526: ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
01527: with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
01528: harpooneers to sleep abreast.
01529: 
01530: “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
01531: that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
01532: yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
01533: eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
01534: 
01535: Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of
01536: the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then
01537: glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
01538: could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,
01539: the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a
01540: whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a
01541: hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a
01542: large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in
01543: lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone
01544: fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon
01545: standing at the head of the bed.
01546: 
01547: But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
01548: light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
01549: arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it
01550: to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little
01551: tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
01552: Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as
01553: you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible
01554: that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
01555: streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to
01556: try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy
01557: and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious
01558: harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit
01559: of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my
01560: life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink
01561: in the neck.
01562: 
01563: I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
01564: head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
01565: the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
01566: the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
01567: little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,
01568: half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about
01569: the harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very
01570: late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,
01571: and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself
01572: to the care of heaven.
01573: 
01574: Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
01575: there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
01576: sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
01577: pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard
01578: a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into
01579: the room from under the door.
01580: 
01581: Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
01582: head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
01583: till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
01584: Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
01585: looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on
01586: the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted
01587: cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was
01588: all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time
01589: while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,
01590: he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was
01591: of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with
01592: large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a
01593: terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here
01594: he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his
01595: face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be
01596: sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were
01597: stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;
01598: but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story
01599: of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had
01600: been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course
01601: of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And
01602: what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be
01603: honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly
01604: complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely
01605: independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be
01606: nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot
01607: sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
01608: never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
01609: extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
01610: passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
01611: all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
01612: fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
01613: seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in
01614: the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
01615: thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
01616: hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
01617: There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a
01618: small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now
01619: looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
01620: stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
01621: than ever I bolted a dinner.
01622: 
01623: Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but
01624: it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
01625: head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
01626: Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and
01627: confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of
01628: him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
01629: the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game
01630: enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
01631: concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
01632: 
01633: Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
01634: his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were
01635: checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all
01636: over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’
01637: War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still
01638: more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs
01639: were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that
01640: he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman
01641: in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to
01642: think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own
01643: brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
01644: 
01645: But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
01646: something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
01647: that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,
01648: or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in
01649: the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image
01650: with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old
01651: Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought
01652: that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar
01653: manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened
01654: a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing
01655: but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage
01656: goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,
01657: sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the
01658: andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
01659: so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine
01660: or chapel for his Congo idol.
01661: 
01662: I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
01663: ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
01664: about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
01665: them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
01666: top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into
01667: a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the
01668: fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed
01669: to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the
01670: biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite
01671: offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to
01672: fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these
01673: strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from
01674: the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing
01675: some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in
01676: the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the
01677: idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket
01678: as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
01679: 
01680: All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing
01681: him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
01682: operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
01683: now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which
01684: I had so long been bound.
01685: 
01686: But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
01687: Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for
01688: an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the
01689: handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment
01690: the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between
01691: his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it
01692: now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
01693: 
01694: Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
01695: against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
01696: be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his
01697: guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
01698: meaning.
01699: 
01700: “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”
01701: And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
01702: dark.
01703: 
01704: “Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!
01705: Coffin! Angels! save me!”
01706: 
01707: “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
01708: cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
01709: hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
01710: But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
01711: in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
01712: 
01713: “Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
01714: harm a hair of your head.”
01715: 
01716: “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that
01717: infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
01718: 
01719: “I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
01720: around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
01721: here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
01722: 
01723: “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
01724: sitting up in bed.
01725: 
01726: “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
01727: throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a
01728: civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a
01729: moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
01730: looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,
01731: thought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just
01732: as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep
01733: with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
01734: 
01735: “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
01736: whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will
01737: turn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with
01738: me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”
01739: 
01740: This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
01741: motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to
01742: say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”
01743: 
01744: “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
01745: 
01746: I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
01747: 
01748: 
01749: CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
01750: 
01751: Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown
01752: over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost
01753: thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of
01754: odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
01755: tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
01756: two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his
01757: keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
01758: sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I
01759: say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
01760: quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I
01761: could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
01762: together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I
01763: could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.
01764: 
01765: My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
01766: child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
01767: whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
01768: circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I
01769: think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little
01770: sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
01771: was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my
01772: mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
01773: bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
01774: the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But
01775: there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the
01776: third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
01777: and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
01778: 
01779: I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
01780: before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small
01781: of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun
01782: shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the
01783: streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse
01784: and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
01785: stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at
01786: her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
01787: slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to
01788: lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and
01789: most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For
01790: several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than
01791: I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.
01792: At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
01793: slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the
01794: before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt
01795: a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and
01796: nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
01797: My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,
01798: silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely
01799: seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,
01800: frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet
01801: ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid
01802: spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided
01803: away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it
01804: all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in
01805: confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I
01806: often puzzle myself with it.
01807: 
01808: Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
01809: supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
01810: those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm
01811: thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly
01812: recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to
01813: the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
01814: bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
01815: as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
01816: him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my
01817: neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a
01818: slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
01819: sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A
01820: pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the
01821: broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of
01822: goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and
01823: loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
01824: hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
01825: extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself
01826: all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in
01827: bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if
01828: he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
01829: consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
01830: him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
01831: now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at
01832: last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
01833: and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon
01834: the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
01835: if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress
01836: afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,
01837: under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
01838: truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you
01839: will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this
01840: particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much
01841: civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
01842: staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for
01843: the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,
01844: a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well
01845: worth unusual regarding.
01846: 
01847: He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
01848: one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his
01849: boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
01850: next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the
01851: bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
01852: was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I
01853: ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
01854: boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
01855: stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized
01856: to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His
01857: education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not
01858: been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled
01859: himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,
01860: he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At
01861: last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over
01862: his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
01863: being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
01864: ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him
01865: at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.
01866: 
01867: Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
01868: street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
01869: into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
01870: Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;
01871: I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
01872: particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He
01873: complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the
01874: morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my
01875: amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
01876: chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a
01877: piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water
01878: and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept
01879: his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed
01880: corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it
01881: a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the
01882: wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.
01883: Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a
01884: vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came
01885: to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how
01886: exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.
01887: 
01888: The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
01889: the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
01890: harpoon like a marshal’s baton.
01891: 
01892: 
01893: CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
01894: 
01895: I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
01896: grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
01897: though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
01898: bedfellow.
01899: 
01900: However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
01901: good thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper
01902: person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be
01903: backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
01904: that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about
01905: him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.
01906: 
01907: The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
01908: night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
01909: nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,
01910: and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and
01911: harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky
01912: beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning
01913: gowns.
01914: 
01915: You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
01916: young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and
01917: would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days
01918: landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades
01919: lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the
01920: complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
01921: bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who
01922: could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,
01923: seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,
01924: contrasting climates, zone by zone.
01925: 
01926: “Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
01927: went to breakfast.
01928: 
01929: They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
01930: in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:
01931: Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
01932: one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But
01933: perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
01934: Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in
01935: the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s
01936: performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode
01937: of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort
01938: of thing is to be had anywhere.
01939: 
01940: These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
01941: after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some
01942: good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
01943: maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
01944: embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
01945: slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire
01946: strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here
01947: they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of
01948: kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
01949: had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
01950: Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
01951: whalemen!
01952: 
01953: But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of
01954: the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
01955: cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
01956: cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,
01957: and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,
01958: to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks
01959: towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and
01960: every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly
01961: is to do it genteelly.
01962: 
01963: We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
01964: coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
01965: beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew
01966: like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was
01967: sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat
01968: on, when I sallied out for a stroll.
01969: 
01970: 
01971: CHAPTER 6. The Street.
01972: 
01973: If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
01974: an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
01975: civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
01976: daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
01977: 
01978: In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
01979: frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
01980: parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners
01981: will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not
01982: unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
01983: Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water
01984: Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only
01985: sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street
01986: corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
01987: flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
01988: 
01989: But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
01990: and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
01991: which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
01992: more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
01993: scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
01994: and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
01995: fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and
01996: snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence
01997: they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.
01998: Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat
01999: and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
02000: Here comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.
02001: 
02002: No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a
02003: downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
02004: two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
02005: country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
02006: reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the
02007: comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his
02008: sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his
02009: canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those
02010: straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,
02011: buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.
02012: 
02013: But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
02014: and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a
02015: queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would
02016: this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of
02017: Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten
02018: one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to
02019: live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not
02020: like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run
02021: with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.
02022: Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more
02023: patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New
02024: Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of
02025: a country?
02026: 
02027: Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
02028: mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave
02029: houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
02030: oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the
02031: bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
02032: 
02033: In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
02034: daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
02035: You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,
02036: they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
02037: burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
02038: 
02039: In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long
02040: avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful
02041: and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
02042: their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is
02043: art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright
02044: terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at
02045: creation’s final day.
02046: 
02047: And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
02048: roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
02049: is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that
02050: bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young
02051: girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
02052: shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of
02053: the Puritanic sands.
02054: 
02055: 
02056: CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.
02057: 
02058: In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are
02059: the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who
02060: fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.
02061: 
02062: Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
02063: special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
02064: sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
02065: bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found
02066: a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and
02067: widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
02068: of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart
02069: from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and
02070: incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these
02071: silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
02072: tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the
02073: pulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not
02074: pretend to quote:—
02075: 
02076: SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was
02077: lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_
02078: 1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.
02079: 
02080: SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,
02081: WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’
02082: crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the
02083: Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _December_ 31_st_, 1839. THIS MARBLE
02084: Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.
02085: 
02086: SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows
02087: of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, _August_
02088: 3_d_, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.
02089: 
02090: Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
02091: myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
02092: Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a
02093: wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage
02094: was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because
02095: he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading
02096: those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of
02097: the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,
02098: I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,
02099: and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not
02100: the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here
02101: before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of
02102: those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed
02103: afresh.
02104: 
02105: Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
02106: among flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the
02107: desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in
02108: those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in
02109: those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden
02110: infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse
02111: resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a
02112: grave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as
02113: here.
02114: 
02115: In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
02116: why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
02117: tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is
02118: that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
02119: so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
02120: he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the
02121: Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what
02122: eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
02123: antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we
02124: still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
02125: dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all
02126: the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify
02127: a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.
02128: 
02129: But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
02130: dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
02131: 
02132: It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
02133: Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
02134: light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
02135: had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But
02136: somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine
02137: chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an
02138: immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a
02139: speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what
02140: then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.
02141: Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
02142: substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too
02143: much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking
02144: that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees
02145: of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is
02146: not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat
02147: and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.
02148: 
02149: 
02150: CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
02151: 
02152: I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
02153: robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
02154: admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
02155: sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it
02156: was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
02157: was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in
02158: his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the
02159: ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy
02160: winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging
02161: into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his
02162: wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing
02163: bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No
02164: one having previously heard his history, could for the first time
02165: behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were
02166: certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that
02167: adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that
02168: he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for
02169: his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot
02170: cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
02171: the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one
02172: by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
02173: when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
02174: 
02175: Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
02176: regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
02177: floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
02178: architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
02179: finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side
02180: ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife
02181: of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of
02182: red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely
02183: headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,
02184: considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad
02185: taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both
02186: hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple
02187: cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still
02188: reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if
02189: ascending the main-top of his vessel.
02190: 
02191: The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
02192: with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of
02193: wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of
02194: the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
02195: these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not
02196: prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn
02197: round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
02198: step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
02199: impregnable in his little Quebec.
02200: 
02201: I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
02202: Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
02203: sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
02204: mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober
02205: reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
02206: Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies
02207: his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties
02208: and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the
02209: word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a
02210: self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial
02211: well of water within the walls.
02212: 
02213: But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
02214: borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble
02215: cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
02216: was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
02217: against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
02218: breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there
02219: floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s
02220: face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
02221: ship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
02222: the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel
02223: seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
02224: helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
02225: off—serenest azure is at hand.”
02226: 
02227: Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
02228: had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
02229: likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
02230: projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed
02231: beak.
02232: 
02233: What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s
02234: foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the
02235: world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first
02236: descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is
02237: the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.
02238: Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;
02239: and the pulpit is its prow.
02240: 
02241: 
02242: CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.
02243: 
02244: Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
02245: the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away
02246: to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”
02247: 
02248: There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
02249: still slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and
02250: every eye on the preacher.
02251: 
02252: He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his
02253: large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
02254: offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
02255: at the bottom of the sea.
02256: 
02257: This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
02258: bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he
02259: commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
02260: the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—
02261: 
02262: 
02263:   “The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,
02264:   While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down
02265:   to doom.
02266: 
02267:   “I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;
02268:   Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to
02269:   despair.
02270: 
02271:   “In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him
02272:   mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints— No more the whale did me
02273:   confine.
02274: 
02275:   “With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;
02276:   Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.
02277: 
02278:   “My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I
02279:   give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.”
02280: 
02281: 
02282: 
02283: 
02284: Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
02285: howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
02286: over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
02287: the proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the
02288: first chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
02289: Jonah.’”
02290: 
02291: “Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one
02292: of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what
02293: depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
02294: lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in
02295: the fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the
02296: floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the
02297: waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_
02298: is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a
02299: two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to
02300: me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us
02301: all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly
02302: awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally
02303: the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the
02304: sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the
02305: command of God—never mind now what that command was, or how
02306: conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God
02307: would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he
02308: oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we
02309: must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein
02310: the hardness of obeying God consists.
02311: 
02312: “With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at
02313: God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men
02314: will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
02315: Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks
02316: a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto
02317: unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no
02318: other city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.
02319: And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from
02320: Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when
02321: the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern
02322: Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,
02323: the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
02324: westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not
02325: then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?
02326: Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
02327: slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the
02328: shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So
02329: disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen
02330: in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had
02331: been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no
02332: baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him
02333: to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
02334: finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as
02335: he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
02336: the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s
02337: evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
02338: confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the
02339: man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but
02340: still serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a
02341: widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I
02342: guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,
02343: one of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill
02344: that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is
02345: moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a
02346: parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and
02347: looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now
02348: crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah
02349: trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so
02350: much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that
02351: itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the
02352: sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him
02353: pass, and he descends into the cabin.
02354: 
02355: “‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
02356: out his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless
02357: question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
02358: But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon
02359: sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,
02360: though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that
02361: hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the
02362: next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing
02363: him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a
02364: passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away
02365: the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage
02366: money how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,
02367: shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,
02368: ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with
02369: the context, this is full of meaning.
02370: 
02371: “Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
02372: crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In
02373: this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and
02374: without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all
02375: frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s
02376: purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;
02377: and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;
02378: but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with
02379: gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions
02380: still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
02381: Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his
02382: passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m
02383: travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,
02384: ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock
02385: contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain
02386: laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of
02387: convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed
02388: and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the
02389: little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
02390: close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,
02391: beneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment
02392: of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of
02393: his bowels’ wards.
02394: 
02395: “Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
02396: oscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
02397: wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
02398: all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
02399: with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
02400: itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
02401: hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his
02402: tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
02403: fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that
02404: contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the
02405: ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
02406: me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
02407: soul are all in crookedness!’
02408: 
02409: “Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
02410: reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
02411: Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;
02412: as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy
02413: anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at
02414: last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as
02415: over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and
02416: there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,
02417: Jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
02418: 
02419: “And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
02420: from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
02421: glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
02422: smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not
02423: bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
02424: break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when
02425: boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is
02426: shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
02427: trampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,
02428: Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,
02429: feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far
02430: rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving
02431: the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides
02432: of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast
02433: asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead
02434: ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy
02435: by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the
02436: deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he
02437: is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave
02438: after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs
02439: roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet
02440: afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the
02441: steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing
02442: bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
02443: tormented deep.
02444: 
02445: “Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his
02446: cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The
02447: sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
02448: and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to
02449: high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this
02450: great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then
02451: how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine
02452: occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,
02453: my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask
02454: him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer
02455: to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put
02456: by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard
02457: hand of God that is upon him.
02458: 
02459: “‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven
02460: who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well
02461: mightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to
02462: make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
02463: appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating
02464: God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
02465: deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
02466: forth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest
02467: was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means
02468: to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;
02469: then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not
02470: unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.
02471: 
02472: “And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
02473: when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
02474: is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water
02475: behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
02476: commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
02477: the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory
02478: teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed
02479: unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and
02480: learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and
02481: wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is
02482: just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with
02483: this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards
02484: His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;
02485: not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing
02486: to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance
02487: of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah
02488: before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a
02489: model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it
02490: like Jonah.”
02491: 
02492: While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
02493: slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
02494: when describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
02495: His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
02496: the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
02497: off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his
02498: simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
02499: 
02500: There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
02501: leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
02502: closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
02503: 
02504: But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
02505: with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
02506: words:
02507: 
02508: “Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
02509: upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
02510: Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to
02511: me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come
02512: down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,
02513: and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other
02514: and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the
02515: living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true
02516: things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the
02517: ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should
02518: raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God
02519: by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never
02520: reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed
02521: him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him
02522: along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him
02523: ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’
02524: and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond
02525: the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale
02526: grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the
02527: engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the
02528: fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale
02529: came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the
02530: delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’
02531: when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and
02532: beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring
02533: of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,
02534: shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!
02535: 
02536: “This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
02537: the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from
02538: Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God
02539: has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than
02540: to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe
02541: to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would
02542: not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him
02543: who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is
02544: himself a castaway!”
02545: 
02546: He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
02547: face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with
02548: a heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
02549: every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
02550: than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than
02551: the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward
02552: delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever
02553: stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
02554: arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
02555: gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
02556: truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
02557: from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant
02558: delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his
02559: God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the
02560: waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
02561: from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness
02562: will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
02563: breath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal,
02564: here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s,
02565: or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is
02566: man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”
02567: 
02568: He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
02569: his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
02570: and he was left alone in the place.
02571: 
02572: 
02573: CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.
02574: 
02575: Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
02576: quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
02577: time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the
02578: stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that
02579: little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
02580: jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
02581: himself in his heathenish way.
02582: 
02583: But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
02584: to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
02585: began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
02586: page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
02587: giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He
02588: would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number
02589: one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was
02590: only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
02591: astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.
02592: 
02593: With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and
02594: hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance
02595: yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You
02596: cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I
02597: saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,
02598: fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
02599: thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty
02600: bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not
02601: altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never
02602: had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,
02603: his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked
02604: more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to
02605: decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent
02606: one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s
02607: head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long
02608: regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were
02609: likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on
02610: top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
02611: 
02612: Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
02613: looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
02614: presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
02615: appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
02616: book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
02617: previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found
02618: thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference
02619: of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do
02620: not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their
02621: calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had
02622: noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,
02623: with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;
02624: appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
02625: All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there
02626: was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand
02627: miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only
02628: way he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though
02629: he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
02630: preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;
02631: always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;
02632: though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,
02633: perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of
02634: so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man
02635: gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the
02636: dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”
02637: 
02638: As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
02639: mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
02640: only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering
02641: round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the
02642: storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of
02643: strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart
02644: and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing
02645: savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a
02646: nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland
02647: deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to
02648: feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that
02649: would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus
02650: drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness
02651: has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some
02652: friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At
02653: first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my
02654: referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me
02655: whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I
02656: thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.
02657: 
02658: We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
02659: him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
02660: that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
02661: went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
02662: be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
02663: producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And
02664: then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it
02665: regularly passing between us.
02666: 
02667: If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s
02668: breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
02669: left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
02670: unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
02671: forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
02672: henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we
02673: were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a
02674: countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too
02675: premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage
02676: those old rules would not apply.
02677: 
02678: After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
02679: together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
02680: enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
02681: thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
02682: mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them
02683: towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he
02684: silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.
02685: He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
02686: the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed
02687: anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I
02688: deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or
02689: otherwise.
02690: 
02691: I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
02692: Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
02693: worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
02694: suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
02695: earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an
02696: insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do
02697: the will of God—_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do
02698: to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is
02699: the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish
02700: that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular
02701: Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him
02702: in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped
02703: prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
02704: Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
02705: done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
02706: and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
02707: 
02708: How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
02709: disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the
02710: very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often
02711: lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our
02712: hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.
02713: 
02714: 
02715: CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.
02716: 
02717: We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
02718: Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
02719: over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
02720: and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
02721: little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
02722: getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
02723: 
02724: Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
02725: began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
02726: sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
02727: head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
02728: noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt
02729: very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
02730: indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
02731: room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
02732: small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world
02733: that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If
02734: you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been
02735: so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But
02736: if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
02737: of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
02738: consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For
02739: this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,
02740: which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height
02741: of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket
02742: between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there
02743: you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.
02744: 
02745: We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
02746: once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether
02747: by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
02748: keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
02749: being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
02750: except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper
02751: element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey
02752: part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and
02753: self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the
02754: unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable
02755: revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that
02756: perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide
02757: awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs
02758: from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong
02759: repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how
02760: elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.
02761: For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,
02762: even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy
02763: then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of
02764: insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential
02765: comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.
02766: With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the
02767: Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
02768: hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
02769: 
02770: Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
02771: far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;
02772: and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He
02773: gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of
02774: his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar
02775: with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story
02776: such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.
02777: 
02778: 
02779: CHAPTER 12. Biographical.
02780: 
02781: Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
02782: South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.
02783: 
02784: When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
02785: grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
02786: sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong
02787: desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
02788: two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and
02789: on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
02790: unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal
02791: stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he
02792: nourished in his untutored youth.
02793: 
02794: A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a
02795: passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of
02796: seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence
02797: could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled
02798: off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when
02799: she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a
02800: low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into
02801: the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with
02802: its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and
02803: when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her
02804: side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;
02805: climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the
02806: deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though
02807: hacked in pieces.
02808: 
02809: In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
02810: cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
02811: Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
02812: wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
02813: told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this
02814: sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down
02815: among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter
02816: content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained
02817: no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of
02818: enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he
02819: was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the
02820: arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more
02821: than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of
02822: whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both
02823: miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s
02824: heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the
02825: sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they
02826: spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for
02827: lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a
02828: pagan.
02829: 
02830: And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
02831: wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
02832: ways about him, though now some time from home.
02833: 
02834: By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
02835: a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
02836: being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not
02837: yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,
02838: had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty
02839: pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as
02840: soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he
02841: proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They
02842: had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
02843: sceptre now.
02844: 
02845: I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
02846: movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
02847: this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
02848: intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port
02849: for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to
02850: accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
02851: same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my
02852: every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of
02853: both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
02854: I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,
02855: could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
02856: wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted
02857: with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.
02858: 
02859: His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg
02860: embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
02861: light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon
02862: were sleeping.
02863: 
02864: 
02865: CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.
02866: 
02867: Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
02868: for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my
02869: comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
02870: amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
02871: me and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories
02872: about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
02873: whom I now companied with.
02874: 
02875: We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
02876: poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went
02877: down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the
02878: wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so
02879: much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
02880: streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
02881: heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg
02882: now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I
02883: asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
02884: whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in
02885: substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet
02886: he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
02887: assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
02888: with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and
02889: mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own
02890: scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,
02891: for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.
02892: 
02893: Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
02894: the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The
02895: owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
02896: heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the
02897: thing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
02898: which to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it
02899: fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”
02900: said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
02901: think. Didn’t the people laugh?”
02902: 
02903: Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of
02904: Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
02905: of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and
02906: this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
02907: mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
02908: touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very
02909: stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this
02910: commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a
02911: pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding
02912: guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain
02913: marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over
02914: against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the
02915: King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their
02916: grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such
02917: times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying
02918: the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I
02919: say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial
02920: ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and
02921: consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage
02922: circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the
02923: ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain
02924: precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own
02925: house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
02926: punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said
02927: Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”
02928: 
02929: At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
02930: schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one
02931: side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees
02932: all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of
02933: casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the
02934: world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while
02935: from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises
02936: of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises
02937: were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only
02938: begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,
02939: for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness
02940: of all earthly effort.
02941: 
02942: Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
02943: Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
02944: snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike
02945: earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish
02946: heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea
02947: which will permit no records.
02948: 
02949: At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
02950: His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
02951: teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
02952: the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.
02953: Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
02954: wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.
02955: So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging
02956: bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
02957: the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow
02958: beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything
02959: more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies
02960: and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come
02961: from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these
02962: young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s
02963: hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught
02964: him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
02965: sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern
02966: in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,
02967: while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe
02968: and passed it to me for a puff.
02969: 
02970: “Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
02971: “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”
02972: 
02973: “Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
02974: up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know
02975: you might have killed that chap?”
02976: 
02977: “What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
02978: 
02979: “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing
02980: to the still shivering greenhorn.
02981: 
02982: “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
02983: expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e
02984: so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”
02985: 
02986: “Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if
02987: you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”
02988: 
02989: But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
02990: mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
02991: the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
02992: side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor
02993: fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
02994: hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
02995: seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in
02996: one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
02997: snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable
02998: of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing
02999: the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the
03000: midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and
03001: crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured
03002: one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,
03003: caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next
03004: jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was
03005: run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern
03006: boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long
03007: living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming
03008: like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by
03009: turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I
03010: looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.
03011: The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the
03012: water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming
03013: to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes
03014: more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other
03015: dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor
03016: bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the
03017: captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a
03018: barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
03019: 
03020: Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he
03021: at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He
03022: only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that
03023: done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the
03024: bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
03025: himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
03026: cannibals must help these Christians.”
03027: 
03028: 
03029: CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.
03030: 
03031: Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
03032: fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
03033: 
03034: Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of
03035: the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
03036: than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of
03037: sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than
03038: you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
03039: gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
03040: don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have
03041: to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that
03042: pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
03043: cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,
03044: to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an
03045: oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand
03046: shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
03047: belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
03048: of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
03049: sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
03050: extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.
03051: 
03052: Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
03053: settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle
03054: swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant
03055: Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child
03056: borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the
03057: same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage
03058: they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory
03059: casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.
03060: 
03061: What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
03062: take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs
03063: in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
03064: experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
03065: launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
03066: put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
03067: Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
03068: everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
03069: flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea
03070: Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
03071: his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
03072: malicious assaults!
03073: 
03074: And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
03075: their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like
03076: so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,
03077: and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America
03078: add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English
03079: overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;
03080: two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea
03081: is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
03082: right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;
03083: armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
03084: following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,
03085: other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw
03086: their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone
03087: resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to
03088: it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.
03089: _There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood
03090: would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.
03091: He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among
03092: the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years
03093: he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells
03094: like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.
03095: With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to
03096: sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight
03097: of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his
03098: very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
03099: 
03100: 
03101: CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
03102: 
03103: It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
03104: anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
03105: business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord
03106: of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the
03107: Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
03108: hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin
03109: Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he
03110: plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck
03111: at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a
03112: yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to
03113: the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
03114: corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
03115: man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very
03116: much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg
03117: insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be
03118: left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say
03119: it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in
03120: the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to
03121: inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
03122: mistaking.
03123: 
03124: Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,
03125: swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
03126: old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other
03127: side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.
03128: Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I
03129: could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort
03130: of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,
03131: _two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks
03132: I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;
03133: tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!
03134: and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out
03135: oblique hints touching Tophet?
03136: 
03137: I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
03138: with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
03139: under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured
03140: eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
03141: shirt.
03142: 
03143: “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”
03144: 
03145: “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”
03146: 
03147: And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
03148: Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon
03149: making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
03150: postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
03151: room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
03152: concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
03153: 
03154: “What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.
03155: 
03156: “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
03157: 
03158: “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”
03159: says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
03160: time, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
03161: 
03162: But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
03163: Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
03164: but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading
03165: to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
03166: 
03167: “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us
03168: both on one clam?”
03169: 
03170: However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
03171: apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
03172: came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
03173: hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
03174: hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up
03175: into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully
03176: seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the
03177: frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing
03178: food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we
03179: despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
03180: bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I
03181: would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered
03182: the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few
03183: moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different
03184: flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
03185: 
03186: We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I
03187: to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s
03188: that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,
03189: Queequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”
03190: 
03191: Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
03192: name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
03193: breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
03194: began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area
03195: before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a
03196: polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account
03197: books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the
03198: milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning
03199: happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s
03200: boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
03201: marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,
03202: looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
03203: 
03204: Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
03205: concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to
03206: precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded
03207: his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;
03208: “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because
03209: it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that
03210: unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
03211: only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,
03212: with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to
03213: take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”
03214: (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and
03215: keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow
03216: for breakfast, men?”
03217: 
03218: “Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
03219: variety.”
03220: 
03221: 
03222: CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
03223: 
03224: In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no
03225: small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
03226: diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo
03227: had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
03228: everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
03229: harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,
03230: Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest
03231: wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
03232: to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,
03233: I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though
03234: it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship
03235: myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
03236: 
03237: I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
03238: confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast
03239: of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather
03240: good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in
03241: all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
03242: 
03243: Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection
03244: of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little
03245: relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to
03246: carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances
03247: produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and
03248: accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined
03249: rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that
03250: trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up
03251: with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of
03252: Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
03253: Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,
03254: though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his
03255: liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his
03256: tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
03257: shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged
03258: sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three
03259: ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the
03260: Pequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;
03261: _Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated
03262: tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I
03263: peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the
03264: Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
03265: a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
03266: 
03267: You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
03268: know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
03269: galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
03270: rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old
03271: school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed
03272: look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and
03273: calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a
03274: French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her
03275: venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of
03276: Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts
03277: stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her
03278: ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped
03279: flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these
03280: her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
03281: to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
03282: followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he
03283: commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one
03284: of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term
03285: of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and
03286: inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
03287: unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or
03288: bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his
03289: neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of
03290: trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
03291: bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
03292: garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the
03293: sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews
03294: and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,
03295: but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile
03296: wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller
03297: was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her
03298: hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,
03299: felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching
03300: its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things
03301: are touched with that.
03302: 
03303: Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
03304: authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at
03305: first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of
03306: tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It
03307: seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical
03308: shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber
03309: black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the
03310: right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of
03311: these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at
03312: the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved
03313: to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A
03314: triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the
03315: insider commanded a complete view forward.
03316: 
03317: And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
03318: his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
03319: ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
03320: command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
03321: over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a
03322: stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
03323: constructed.
03324: 
03325: There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
03326: the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
03327: and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;
03328: only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
03329: wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his
03330: continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
03331: windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
03332: together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
03333: 
03334: “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of
03335: the tent.
03336: 
03337: “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of
03338: him?” he demanded.
03339: 
03340: “I was thinking of shipping.”
03341: 
03342: “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a
03343: stove boat?”
03344: 
03345: “No, Sir, I never have.”
03346: 
03347: “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
03348: 
03349: “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been
03350: several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
03351: 
03352: “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that
03353: leg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of
03354: the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose
03355: now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant
03356: ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it
03357: looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast
03358: thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of
03359: murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
03360: 
03361: I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
03362: these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
03363: Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
03364: distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
03365: Vineyard.
03366: 
03367: “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
03368: shipping ye.”
03369: 
03370: “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
03371: 
03372: “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
03373: 
03374: “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
03375: 
03376: “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
03377: 
03378: “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
03379: 
03380: “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,
03381: young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
03382: out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
03383: are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest
03384: to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way
03385: of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap
03386: eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one
03387: leg.”
03388: 
03389: “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
03390: 
03391: “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
03392: up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
03393: boat!—ah, ah!”
03394: 
03395: I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
03396: the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I
03397: could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
03398: there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
03399: I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
03400: 
03401: “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou
03402: dost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure
03403: of that?”
03404: 
03405: “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in
03406: the merchant—”
03407: 
03408: “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant
03409: service—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each
03410: other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel
03411: inclined for it?”
03412: 
03413: “I do, sir.”
03414: 
03415: “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
03416: whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
03417: 
03418: “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
03419: be got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”
03420: 
03421: “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find
03422: out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to
03423: see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just
03424: step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back
03425: to me and tell me what ye see there.”
03426: 
03427: For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
03428: knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
03429: concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started
03430: me on the errand.
03431: 
03432: Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
03433: ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
03434: pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but
03435: exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I
03436: could see.
03437: 
03438: “Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye
03439: see?”
03440: 
03441: “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
03442: and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”
03443: 
03444: “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
03445: round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where
03446: you stand?”
03447: 
03448: I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
03449: Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now
03450: repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
03451: willingness to ship me.
03452: 
03453: “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come
03454: along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
03455: cabin.
03456: 
03457: Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
03458: surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with
03459: Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
03460: shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
03461: of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;
03462: each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a
03463: nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in
03464: whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
03465: stocks bringing in good interest.
03466: 
03467: Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
03468: Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to
03469: this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
03470: peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by
03471: things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same
03472: Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
03473: are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
03474: 
03475: So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
03476: Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in
03477: childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
03478: Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
03479: adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
03480: unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
03481: unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when
03482: these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a
03483: globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and
03484: seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and
03485: beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
03486: untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or
03487: savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
03488: breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
03489: advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes
03490: one in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for
03491: noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically
03492: regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
03493: a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For
03494: all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be
03495: sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.
03496: But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;
03497: and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from
03498: another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
03499: 
03500: Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
03501: But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called
03502: serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
03503: veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally
03504: educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but
03505: all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely
03506: island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native
03507: born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
03508: vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
03509: consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from
03510: conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
03511: had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn
03512: foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled
03513: tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening
03514: of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the
03515: reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
03516: and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible
03517: conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world
03518: quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little
03519: cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
03520: broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,
03521: chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted
03522: before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from
03523: active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining
03524: days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
03525: 
03526: Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
03527: incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
03528: task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
03529: curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
03530: upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,
03531: sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,
03532: he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used
03533: to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an
03534: inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When
03535: Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking
03536: at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch
03537: something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at
03538: something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished
03539: before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian
03540: character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no
03541: superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like
03542: the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
03543: 
03544: Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
03545: followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
03546: was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,
03547: and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was
03548: placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was
03549: buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
03550: reading from a ponderous volume.
03551: 
03552: “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
03553: studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
03554: certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
03555: 
03556: As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
03557: Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
03558: and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
03559: 
03560: “He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
03561: 
03562: “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
03563: 
03564: “I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
03565: 
03566: “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
03567: 
03568: “He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
03569: his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
03570: 
03571: I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,
03572: his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said
03573: nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,
03574: and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,
03575: and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time
03576: to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for
03577: the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid
03578: no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares
03579: of the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to
03580: the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the
03581: ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my
03582: own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the
03583: sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt
03584: that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th
03585: lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,
03586: whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was
03587: what they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and
03588: if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I
03589: would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,
03590: for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
03591: 
03592: It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
03593: fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
03594: that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
03595: world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this
03596: grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the
03597: 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been
03598: surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a
03599: broad-shouldered make.
03600: 
03601: But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
03602: receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
03603: something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
03604: how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore
03605: the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the
03606: whole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know
03607: but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
03608: shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
03609: quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
03610: own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
03611: jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he
03612: was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded
03613: us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for
03614: yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
03615: 
03616: “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay
03617: shall we give this young man?”
03618: 
03619: “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
03620: seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do
03621: corrupt, but _lay_—’”
03622: 
03623: _Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
03624: seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
03625: shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do
03626: corrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from
03627: the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
03628: the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
03629: seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a
03630: _teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and
03631: seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
03632: hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
03633: 
03634: “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to
03635: swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
03636: 
03637: “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting
03638: his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there
03639: will your heart be also.”
03640: 
03641: “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do
03642: ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
03643: 
03644: Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
03645: “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the
03646: duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,
03647: many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
03648: young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
03649: orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
03650: 
03651: “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
03652: cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these
03653: matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
03654: heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
03655: Horn.”
03656: 
03657: “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing
03658: ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art
03659: still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy
03660: conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering
03661: down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
03662: 
03663: “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
03664: insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
03665: he’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,
03666: and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
03667: with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
03668: drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
03669: 
03670: As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
03671: marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
03672: 
03673: Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
03674: responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
03675: idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
03676: commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,
03677: I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
03678: wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
03679: transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
03680: withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As
03681: for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
03682: left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
03683: little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the
03684: squall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at
03685: sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
03686: the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,
03687: Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
03688: for the three hundredth lay.”
03689: 
03690: “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship
03691: too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
03692: 
03693: “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
03694: 
03695: “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
03696: which he had again been burying himself.
03697: 
03698: “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever
03699: whaled it any?” turning to me.
03700: 
03701: “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
03702: 
03703: “Well, bring him along then.”
03704: 
03705: And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I
03706: had done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical
03707: ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
03708: 
03709: But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the
03710: Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
03711: indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and
03712: receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by
03713: arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,
03714: and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the
03715: captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he
03716: does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to
03717: the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to
03718: have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his
03719: hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain
03720: Ahab was to be found.
03721: 
03722: “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou
03723: art shipped.”
03724: 
03725: “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
03726: 
03727: “But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know
03728: exactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
03729: house; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t
03730: sick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always
03731: see me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain
03732: Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no
03733: fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;
03734: doesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
03735: Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the common; Ahab’s been in
03736: colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders
03737: than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than
03738: whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our
03739: isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain’t Captain Peleg;
03740: _he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
03741: 
03742: “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
03743: they not lick his blood?”
03744: 
03745: “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in
03746: his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board
03747: the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
03748: ’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died
03749: when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at
03750: Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,
03751: perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn
03752: thee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as
03753: mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,
03754: like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a
03755: good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;
03756: and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind
03757: for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump
03758: that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever
03759: since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a
03760: kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all
03761: pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young
03762: man, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
03763: one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens
03764: to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages
03765: wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that
03766: old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm
03767: in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
03768: humanities!”
03769: 
03770: As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
03771: incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
03772: wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,
03773: I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what,
03774: unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange
03775: awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was
03776: not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did
03777: not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed
03778: like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.
03779: However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so
03780: that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.
03781: 
03782: 
03783: CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
03784: 
03785: As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
03786: day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
03787: cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,
03788: never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
03789: even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
03790: creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of
03791: footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the
03792: torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
03793: inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.
03794: 
03795: I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
03796: things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
03797: pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
03798: subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
03799: absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg
03800: thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
03801: and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let
03802: him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans
03803: alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
03804: sadly need mending.
03805: 
03806: Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
03807: rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
03808: but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
03809: “Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,
03810: Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still
03811: as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant
03812: time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through
03813: the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the
03814: key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see
03815: part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing
03816: more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden
03817: shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous
03818: had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,
03819: thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he
03820: seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside
03821: here, and no possible mistake.
03822: 
03823: “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.
03824: Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
03825: Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
03826: I met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must
03827: be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
03828: locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
03829: since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
03830: baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
03831: Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I
03832: following.
03833: 
03834: Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
03835: vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
03836: of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy
03837: meantime.
03838: 
03839: “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
03840: something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke;
03841: depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
03842: again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
03843: vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
03844: 
03845: “What’s the matter with you, young man?”
03846: 
03847: “Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry
03848: it open!”
03849: 
03850: “Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,
03851: so as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying
03852: open any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the
03853: matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”
03854: 
03855: In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
03856: the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of
03857: her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
03858: seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the
03859: landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
03860: Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
03861: unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God
03862: pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad
03863: a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,
03864: and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and
03865: no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?
03866: The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young
03867: man, avast there!”
03868: 
03869: And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
03870: open the door.
03871: 
03872: “I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the
03873: locksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her
03874: hand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s
03875: see.” And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s
03876: supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.
03877: 
03878: “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a
03879: little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing
03880: I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a
03881: sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.
03882: 
03883: With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
03884: against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
03885: heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right
03886: in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on
03887: top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
03888: like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.
03889: 
03890: “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with
03891: you?”
03892: 
03893: “He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.
03894: 
03895: But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
03896: like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
03897: intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
03898: especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
03899: eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
03900: 
03901: “Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you
03902: please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”
03903: 
03904: Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
03905: Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could
03906: do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,
03907: nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
03908: the slightest way.
03909: 
03910: I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
03911: they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
03912: yes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll
03913: get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,
03914: and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very
03915: punctual then.
03916: 
03917: I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
03918: stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
03919: as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or
03920: brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);
03921: after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I
03922: went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg
03923: must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there
03924: he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began
03925: to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to
03926: be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
03927: holding a piece of wood on his head.
03928: 
03929: “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and
03930: have some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But
03931: not a word did he reply.
03932: 
03933: Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
03934: and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
03935: turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
03936: it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his
03937: ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not
03938: get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere
03939: thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy
03940: position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really
03941: wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide
03942: awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
03943: 
03944: But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
03945: day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he
03946: had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of
03947: sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but
03948: with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his
03949: forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
03950: 
03951: Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,
03952: be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
03953: other person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when
03954: a man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment
03955: to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
03956: lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and
03957: argue the point with him.
03958: 
03959: And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed
03960: now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
03961: and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
03962: religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
03963: Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings
03964: in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
03965: useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene
03966: and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such
03967: an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly
03968: pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous
03969: Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;
03970: hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must
03971: necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic
03972: religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In
03973: one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first
03974: born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated
03975: through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.
03976: 
03977: I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
03978: dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
03979: in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great
03980: feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
03981: wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the
03982: afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.
03983: 
03984: “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
03985: inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who
03986: had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,
03987: when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in
03988: the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were
03989: placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,
03990: with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,
03991: were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just
03992: as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.
03993: 
03994: After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
03995: impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow
03996: seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
03997: from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
03998: than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
03999: finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
04000: religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending
04001: concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such
04002: a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
04003: piety.
04004: 
04005: At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
04006: breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not
04007: make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the
04008: Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.
04009: 
04010: 
04011: CHAPTER 18. His Mark.
04012: 
04013: As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
04014: carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
04015: from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
04016: and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that
04017: craft, unless they previously produced their papers.
04018: 
04019: “What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the
04020: bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
04021: 
04022: “I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
04023: 
04024: “Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
04025: behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.
04026: Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present
04027: in communion with any Christian church?”
04028: 
04029: “Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here
04030: be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
04031: last come to be converted into the churches.
04032: 
04033: “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in
04034: Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out
04035: his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
04036: handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
04037: wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
04038: Queequeg.
04039: 
04040: “How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not
04041: very long, I rather guess, young man.”
04042: 
04043: “No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it
04044: would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
04045: 
04046: “Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of
04047: Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass
04048: it every Lord’s day.”
04049: 
04050: “I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said
04051: I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
04052: Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
04053: 
04054: “Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain
04055: thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
04056: 
04057: Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same
04058: ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
04059: and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us
04060: belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
04061: worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
04062: queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all
04063: join hands.”
04064: 
04065: “Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
04066: “Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast
04067: hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father
04068: Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come
04069: aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog
04070: there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great
04071: anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and
04072: he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did
04073: you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a
04074: fish?”
04075: 
04076: Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
04077: the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
04078: hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
04079: harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—
04080: 
04081: “Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
04082: spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he
04083: darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the
04084: ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
04085: 
04086: “Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e
04087: eye; why, dad whale dead.”
04088: 
04089: “Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
04090: vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
04091: gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must
04092: have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,
04093: Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was
04094: given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
04095: 
04096: So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
04097: enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
04098: 
04099: When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
04100: signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know
04101: how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
04102: or make thy mark?”
04103: 
04104: But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
04105: part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
04106: offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
04107: counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
04108: that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his
04109: appellative, it stood something like this:—
04110: 
04111: Quohog. his X mark.
04112: 
04113: Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
04114: and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
04115: broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
04116: entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in
04117: Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
04118: looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do
04119: my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for
04120: the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,
04121: which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial
04122: bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the
04123: wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
04124: clear of the fiery pit!”
04125: 
04126: Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,
04127: heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
04128: 
04129: “Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”
04130: cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the
04131: shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty
04132: sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out
04133: of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never
04134: came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he
04135: shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case
04136: he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
04137: 
04138: “Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,
04139: as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what
04140: it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this
04141: ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this
04142: same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on
04143: Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st
04144: thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
04145: 
04146: “Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
04147: thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.
04148: Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death
04149: and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an
04150: everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over
04151: us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to
04152: think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking
04153: of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the
04154: nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
04155: 
04156: Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where
04157: we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
04158: sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he
04159: stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
04160: otherwise might have been wasted.
04161: 
04162: 
04163: CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.
04164: 
04165: “Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”
04166: 
04167: Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
04168: the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the
04169: above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
04170: levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but
04171: shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
04172: black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
04173: directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated
04174: ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
04175: 
04176: “Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.
04177: 
04178: “You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little
04179: more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
04180: 
04181: “Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,
04182: and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
04183: bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
04184: 
04185: “Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”
04186: 
04187: “Anything down there about your souls?”
04188: 
04189: “About what?”
04190: 
04191: “Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though,
04192: I know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are
04193: all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a
04194: wagon.”
04195: 
04196: “What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.
04197: 
04198: “_He’s_ got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
04199: sort in other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
04200: emphasis upon the word _he_.
04201: 
04202: “Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
04203: somewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”
04204: 
04205: “Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old Thunder
04206: yet, have ye?”
04207: 
04208: “Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness
04209: of his manner.
04210: 
04211: “Captain Ahab.”
04212: 
04213: “What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”
04214: 
04215: “Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye
04216: hav’n’t seen him yet, have ye?”
04217: 
04218: “No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
04219: all right again before long.”
04220: 
04221: “All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
04222: derisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
04223: this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”
04224: 
04225: “What do you know about him?”
04226: 
04227: “What did they _tell_ you about him? Say that!”
04228: 
04229: “They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s
04230: a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”
04231: 
04232: “That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when
04233: he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word with
04234: Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
04235: Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
04236: nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar
04237: in Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
04238: calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last
04239: voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them
04240: matters and something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye?
04241: Who knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve
04242: heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of
04243: that, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—I mean they
04244: know he’s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”
04245: 
04246: “My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
04247: don’t know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be
04248: a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,
04249: of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all
04250: about the loss of his leg.”
04251: 
04252: “_All_ about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”
04253: 
04254: “Pretty sure.”
04255: 
04256: With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
04257: stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
04258: little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
04259: papers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s to be, will
04260: be; and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all
04261: fixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him,
04262: I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye,
04263: shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped
04264: ye.”
04265: 
04266: “Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell
04267: us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
04268: mistaken in your game; that’s all I have to say.”
04269: 
04270: “And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
04271: you are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
04272: morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one
04273: of ’em.”
04274: 
04275: “Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us. It
04276: is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
04277: great secret in him.”
04278: 
04279: “Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”
04280: 
04281: “Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
04282: man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”
04283: 
04284: “Elijah.”
04285: 
04286: Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
04287: other’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
04288: nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone
04289: perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
04290: looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
04291: though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
04292: said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
04293: comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
04294: that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,
04295: but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
04296: circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
04297: shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
04298: and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain
04299: Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver
04300: calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
04301: the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the
04302: voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
04303: things.
04304: 
04305: I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
04306: dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,
04307: and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on,
04308: without seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and
04309: finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
04310: 
04311: 
04312: CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
04313: 
04314: A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
04315: Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
04316: board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
04317: betokened that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close.
04318: Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam
04319: keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing
04320: and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on
04321: the rigging were working till long after night-fall.
04322: 
04323: On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at
04324: all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests
04325: must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
04326: vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,
04327: resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they
04328: always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
04329: for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
04330: there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod
04331: was fully equipped.
04332: 
04333: Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
04334: forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
04335: indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,
04336: which necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far
04337: from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And
04338: though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
04339: to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of
04340: the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution
04341: of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote
04342: harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,
04343: whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and
04344: especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which
04345: the success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare
04346: spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but
04347: a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
04348: 
04349: At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
04350: Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
04351: fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time
04352: there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
04353: ends of things, both large and small.
04354: 
04355: Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
04356: Bildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
04357: spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_
04358: could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after
04359: once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a
04360: jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of
04361: quills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time
04362: with a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back.
04363: Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt
04364: Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this
04365: charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn
04366: her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,
04367: and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
04368: Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
04369: well-saved dollars.
04370: 
04371: But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
04372: board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and
04373: a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
04374: Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him
04375: a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
04376: went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a
04377: while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
04378: down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and
04379: then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.
04380: 
04381: During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
04382: craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
04383: when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they
04384: would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
04385: aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could
04386: attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I
04387: had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly
04388: in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so
04389: long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the
04390: absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open
04391: sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he
04392: be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up
04393: his suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I
04394: said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
04395: 
04396: At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
04397: certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
04398: start.
04399: 
04400: 
04401: CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.
04402: 
04403: It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
04404: drew nigh the wharf.
04405: 
04406: “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
04407: Queequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come
04408: on!”
04409: 
04410: “Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
04411: behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
04412: himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
04413: twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
04414: 
04415: “Going aboard?”
04416: 
04417: “Hands off, will you,” said I.
04418: 
04419: “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
04420: 
04421: “Ain’t going aboard, then?”
04422: 
04423: “Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you
04424: know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”
04425: 
04426: “No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and
04427: wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
04428: glances.
04429: 
04430: “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We
04431: are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
04432: detained.”
04433: 
04434: “Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”
04435: 
04436: “He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”
04437: 
04438: “Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
04439: paces.
04440: 
04441: “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”
04442: 
04443: But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
04444: shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
04445: ship a while ago?”
04446: 
04447: Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,
04448: I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”
04449: 
04450: “Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”
04451: 
04452: Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
04453: touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will
04454: ye?
04455: 
04456: “Find who?”
04457: 
04458: “Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I
04459: was going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one,
04460: all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to
04461: ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the
04462: Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
04463: me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
04464: 
04465: At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
04466: quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
04467: hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward
04468: to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a
04469: light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
04470: tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
04471: face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber
04472: slept upon him.
04473: 
04474: “Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
04475: looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the
04476: wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
04477: would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
04478: matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I
04479: beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to
04480: Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to
04481: establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,
04482: as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,
04483: sat quietly down there.
04484: 
04485: “Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.
04486: 
04487: “Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him
04488: face.”
04489: 
04490: “Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
04491: but how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you
04492: are heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,
04493: he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”
04494: 
04495: Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
04496: lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
04497: over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning
04498: him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
04499: land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
04500: chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening
04501: some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house
04502: comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy
04503: fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was
04504: very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs
04505: which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief
04506: calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself
04507: under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.
04508: 
04509: While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
04510: from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.
04511: 
04512: “What’s that for, Queequeg?”
04513: 
04514: “Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
04515: 
04516: He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
04517: which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
04518: his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
04519: strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to
04520: tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
04521: troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
04522: rubbed his eyes.
04523: 
04524: “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
04525: 
04526: “Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
04527: 
04528: “Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
04529: came aboard last night.”
04530: 
04531: “What Captain?—Ahab?”
04532: 
04533: “Who but him indeed?”
04534: 
04535: I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
04536: heard a noise on deck.
04537: 
04538: “Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,
04539: that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
04540: saying he went on deck, and we followed.
04541: 
04542: It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
04543: threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
04544: engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
04545: last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly
04546: enshrined within his cabin.
04547: 
04548: 
04549: CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
04550: 
04551: At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s
04552: riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
04553: after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
04554: her last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
04555: brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the
04556: two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to
04557: the chief mate, Peleg said:
04558: 
04559: “Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is
04560: all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
04561: Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
04562: 
04563: “No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said
04564: Bildad, “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”
04565: 
04566: How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
04567: Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
04568: quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as
04569: well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign
04570: of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But
04571: then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in
04572: getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,
04573: as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he
04574: was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab
04575: stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the
04576: merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a
04577: considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the
04578: cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,
04579: before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.
04580: 
04581: But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
04582: Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and
04583: commanding, and not Bildad.
04584: 
04585: “Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at
04586: the main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
04587: 
04588: “Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this
04589: whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
04590: Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known
04591: to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
04592: 
04593: “Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and
04594: the crew sprang for the handspikes.
04595: 
04596: Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
04597: is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be
04598: it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed
04599: pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot
04600: in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was
04601: concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might
04602: now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the
04603: approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave
04604: of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some
04605: sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good
04606: will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that
04607: no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in
04608: getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
04609: copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.
04610: 
04611: Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
04612: and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he
04613: would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I
04614: paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of
04615: the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for
04616: a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in
04617: pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred
04618: and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
04619: and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in
04620: the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my
04621: first kick.
04622: 
04623: “Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.
04624: “Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye
04625: spring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
04626: whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
04627: say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved
04628: along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
04629: imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,
04630: Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
04631: 
04632: At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It
04633: was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
04634: night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
04635: freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of
04636: teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
04637: ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
04638: the bows.
04639: 
04640: Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
04641: the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
04642: frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
04643: steady notes were heard,—
04644: 
04645: 
04646: _“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living
04647: green. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_
04648: 
04649: 
04650: 
04651: Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They
04652: were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in
04653: the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there
04654: was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and
04655: meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the
04656: spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
04657: 
04658: At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
04659: longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
04660: alongside.
04661: 
04662: It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected
04663: at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;
04664: very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
04665: voyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his
04666: hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate
04667: sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
04668: encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to
04669: a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad
04670: lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
04671: cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
04672: looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
04673: bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the
04674: land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and
04675: nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
04676: convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
04677: for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
04678: “Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”
04679: 
04680: As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
04681: his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
04682: came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now
04683: a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
04684: 
04685: But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
04686: him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard
04687: there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,
04688: careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to
04689: ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye
04690: all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in
04691: old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”
04692: 
04693: “God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old
04694: Bildad, almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so
04695: that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he
04696: needs, and ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be
04697: careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye
04698: harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
04699: within the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind
04700: that cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in
04701: the green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but
04702: don’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts.
04703: Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I
04704: thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.
04705: Good-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep that cheese too long down in the hold,
04706: Mr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be careful with the butter—twenty cents the
04707: pound it was, and mind ye, if—”
04708: 
04709: “Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that,
04710: Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
04711: 
04712: Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
04713: screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
04714: three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
04715: Atlantic.
04716: 
04717: 
04718: CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.
04719: 
04720: Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
04721: mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
04722: 
04723: When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
04724: bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
04725: helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
04726: the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous
04727: voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
04728: tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest
04729: things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;
04730: this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only
04731: say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that
04732: miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give
04733: succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,
04734: hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our
04735: mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s
04736: direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
04737: though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and
04738: through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
04739: fights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks
04740: all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly
04741: rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
04742: 
04743: Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
04744: intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
04745: effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
04746: wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
04747: treacherous, slavish shore?
04748: 
04749: But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
04750: indefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
04751: than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For
04752: worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the
04753: terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O
04754: Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy
04755: ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!
04756: 
04757: 
04758: CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.
04759: 
04760: As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
04761: and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
04762: landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I
04763: am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby
04764: done to us hunters of whales.
04765: 
04766: In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
04767: the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
04768: accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a
04769: stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
04770: it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
04771: he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
04772: of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale
04773: Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
04774: pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.
04775: 
04776: Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us
04777: whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
04778: butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
04779: are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is
04780: true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
04781: all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And
04782: as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye
04783: shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally
04784: unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm
04785: whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But
04786: even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered
04787: slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable
04788: carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to
04789: drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much
04790: enhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure
04791: ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would
04792: quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail,
04793: fanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the
04794: comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and
04795: wonders of God!
04796: 
04797: But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
04798: unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
04799: adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
04800: round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!
04801: 
04802: But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
04803: scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.
04804: 
04805: Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling
04806: fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit
04807: out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
04808: score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did
04809: Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
04810: upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
04811: America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;
04812: sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
04813: thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
04814: at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our
04815: harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if
04816: there be not something puissant in whaling?
04817: 
04818: But this is not the half; look again.
04819: 
04820: I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
04821: point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
04822: years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken
04823: in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way
04824: and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
04825: continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may
04826: well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
04827: pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to
04828: catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past
04829: the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
04830: least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes
04831: which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If
04832: American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
04833: harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the
04834: whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
04835: between them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the
04836: heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I
04837: say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket,
04838: that were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.
04839: For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish
04840: sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,
04841: battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines
04842: and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a
04843: flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
04844: life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures
04845: which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted
04846: unworthy of being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,
04847: the world!
04848: 
04849: Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
04850: scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
04851: and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
04852: coast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy
04853: of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,
04854: it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated
04855: the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,
04856: and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
04857: 
04858: That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was
04859: given to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first
04860: blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned
04861: those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
04862: there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
04863: Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the
04864: emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
04865: biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
04866: The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
04867: commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
04868: missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
04869: missionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,
04870: Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom
04871: the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.
04872: 
04873: But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
04874: æsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
04875: shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
04876: every time.
04877: 
04878: The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
04879: will say.
04880: 
04881: _The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who
04882: wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who
04883: composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a
04884: prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down
04885: the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And
04886: who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!
04887: 
04888: True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
04889: good blood in their veins.
04890: 
04891: _No good blood in their veins?_ They have something better than royal
04892: blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
04893: afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
04894: Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
04895: harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the
04896: barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.
04897: 
04898: Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
04899: respectable.
04900: 
04901: _Whaling not respectable?_ Whaling is imperial! By old English
04902: statutory law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *
04903: 
04904: Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any
04905: grand imposing way.
04906: 
04907: _The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?_ In one of the
04908: mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s
04909: capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian
04910: coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
04911: 
04912: *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
04913: 
04914: Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
04915: dignity in whaling.
04916: 
04917: _No dignity in whaling?_ The dignity of our calling the very heavens
04918: attest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your
04919: hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I
04920: know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty
04921: whales. I account that man more honorable than that great captain of
04922: antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.
04923: 
04924: And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
04925: undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute
04926: in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably
04927: ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a
04928: man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death,
04929: my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in
04930: my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory
04931: to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.
04932: 
04933: 
04934: CHAPTER 25. Postscript.
04935: 
04936: In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
04937: substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
04938: should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
04939: eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be
04940: blameworthy?
04941: 
04942: It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
04943: modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
04944: functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,
04945: and there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,
04946: precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is
04947: solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,
04948: though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run
04949: well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,
04950: concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
04951: common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints
04952: his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man
04953: who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a
04954: quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to
04955: much in his totality.
04956: 
04957: But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil is
04958: used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
04959: oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
04960: What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
04961: unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
04962: 
04963: Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
04964: queens with coronation stuff!
04965: 
04966: 
04967: CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
04968: 
04969: The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
04970: Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an
04971: icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being
04972: hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood
04973: would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time
04974: of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
04975: his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
04976: summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his
04977: thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties
04978: and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was
04979: merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;
04980: quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and
04981: closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,
04982: like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for
04983: long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow
04984: or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was
04985: warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed
04986: to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
04987: had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life
04988: for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame
04989: chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
04990: were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some
04991: cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly
04992: conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,
04993: the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline
04994: him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some
04995: organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
04996: from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And
04997: if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more
04998: did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,
04999: tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,
05000: and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some
05001: honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often
05002: evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I
05003: will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a
05004: whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and
05005: useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the
05006: encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more
05007: dangerous comrade than a coward.
05008: 
05009: “Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as
05010: careful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall
05011: ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a
05012: man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
05013: 
05014: Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
05015: sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
05016: all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in
05017: this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits
05018: of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly
05019: wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after
05020: sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted
05021: in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical
05022: ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for
05023: theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.
05024: What doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could
05025: he find the torn limbs of his brother?
05026: 
05027: With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
05028: superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
05029: could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But
05030: it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
05031: terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature
05032: that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
05033: him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
05034: confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it
05035: was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
05036: while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
05037: whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
05038: cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
05039: which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged
05040: and mighty man.
05041: 
05042: But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
05043: abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart
05044: to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
05045: the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
05046: stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
05047: men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble
05048: and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
05049: ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
05050: costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so
05051: far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
05052: seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
05053: valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
05054: completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But
05055: this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,
05056: but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt
05057: see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that
05058: democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;
05059: Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all
05060: democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
05061: 
05062: If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
05063: hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
05064: graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among
05065: them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall
05066: touch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a
05067: rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics
05068: bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one
05069: royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou
05070: great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,
05071: Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly
05072: hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old
05073: Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who
05074: didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a
05075: throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest
05076: Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O
05077: God!
05078: 
05079: 
05080: CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
05081: 
05082: Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
05083: according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
05084: neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
05085: indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
05086: chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
05087: for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
05088: whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
05089: crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable
05090: arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about
05091: the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very
05092: death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and
05093: off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his
05094: old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated
05095: monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death
05096: into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no
05097: telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
05098: but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a
05099: comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a
05100: sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,
05101: about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and
05102: not sooner.
05103: 
05104: What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
05105: unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
05106: world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
05107: what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that
05108: thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black
05109: little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would
05110: almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
05111: nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready
05112: loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever
05113: he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
05114: the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in
05115: readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
05116: legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.
05117: 
05118: I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
05119: peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
05120: whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
05121: miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in
05122: time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
05123: handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
05124: tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
05125: disinfecting agent.
05126: 
05127: The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
05128: short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
05129: who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
05130: and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
05131: honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost
05132: was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
05133: bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
05134: any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,
05135: the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
05136: water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
05137: application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This
05138: ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
05139: the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
05140: three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
05141: that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought
05142: nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask
05143: was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
05144: called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
05145: be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in
05146: Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
05147: inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions
05148: of those battering seas.
05149: 
05150: Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.
05151: They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
05152: Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
05153: Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
05154: whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being
05155: armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio
05156: of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
05157: 
05158: And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
05159: Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
05160: who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
05161: former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
05162: moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
05163: and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
05164: down who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
05165: them belonged.
05166: 
05167: First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
05168: for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
05169: 
05170: Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
05171: promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last
05172: remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
05173: neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
05174: harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
05175: Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
05176: and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but
05177: Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently
05178: proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud
05179: warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had
05180: scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer
05181: snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now
05182: hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon
05183: of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look
05184: at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
05185: credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and
05186: half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
05187: of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.
05188: 
05189: Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
05190: negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended
05191: from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
05192: them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
05193: them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
05194: lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been
05195: anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors
05196: most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
05197: life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
05198: manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
05199: and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
05200: feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at
05201: him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
05202: beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,
05203: Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a
05204: chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it
05205: said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
05206: before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans
05207: born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same
05208: with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military
05209: and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the
05210: construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,
05211: because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the
05212: brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No
05213: small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the
05214: outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews
05215: from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the
05216: Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland
05217: Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage
05218: homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,
05219: but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all
05220: Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not
05221: acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on
05222: a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,
05223: what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from
05224: all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying
05225: Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar
05226: from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he
05227: never did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim
05228: Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;
05229: prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck
05230: on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in
05231: glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!
05232: 
05233: 
05234: CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
05235: 
05236: For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
05237: seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the
05238: watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed
05239: to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from
05240: the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was
05241: plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and
05242: dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to
05243: penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.
05244: 
05245: Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
05246: gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
05247: disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
05248: sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at
05249: times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
05250: recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived
05251: of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was
05252: almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
05253: prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
05254: uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
05255: about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
05256: emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
05257: were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
05258: tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
05259: acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the
05260: fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation
05261: in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the
05262: aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was
05263: most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and
05264: induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.
05265: Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own
05266: different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of
05267: them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being
05268: Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
05269: biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
05270: southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,
05271: gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
05272: weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey
05273: and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the
05274: ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping
05275: and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of
05276: the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the
05277: taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;
05278: Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.
05279: 
05280: There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
05281: recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
05282: the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
05283: or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His
05284: whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
05285: unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out
05286: from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
05287: tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you
05288: saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
05289: perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a
05290: great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
05291: without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
05292: top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still
05293: greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or
05294: whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
05295: certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or
05296: no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once
05297: Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,
05298: superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did
05299: Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
05300: fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this
05301: wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman
05302: insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out
05303: of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,
05304: the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
05305: this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no
05306: white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever
05307: Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to
05308: pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the
05309: dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
05310: 
05311: So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
05312: livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly
05313: noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the
05314: barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come
05315: to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished
05316: bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said
05317: the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped
05318: another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”
05319: 
05320: I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
05321: the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
05322: there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
05323: plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
05324: holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
05325: beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest
05326: fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and
05327: fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor
05328: did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest
05329: gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not
05330: painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not
05331: only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion
05332: in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some
05333: mighty woe.
05334: 
05335: Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
05336: But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
05337: standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
05338: heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
05339: grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,
05340: when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
05341: bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
05342: came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,
05343: for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he
05344: seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only
05345: making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
05346: preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
05347: that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite
05348: Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
05349: layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose
05350: the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.
05351: 
05352: Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
05353: pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
05354: from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and
05355: May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,
05356: ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
05357: few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,
05358: in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish
05359: air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,
05360: which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.
05361: 
05362: 
05363: CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
05364: 
05365: Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
05366: rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
05367: perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
05368: Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
05369: redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
05370: up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights
05371: seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
05372: pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted
05373: suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days
05374: and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning
05375: weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward
05376: world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild
05377: hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice
05378: most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more
05379: and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.
05380: 
05381: Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
05382: man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
05383: the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
05384: night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he
05385: seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
05386: were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels
05387: like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an
05388: old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
05389: grave-dug berth.”
05390: 
05391: So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
05392: set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
05393: and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
05394: flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
05395: it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
05396: this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
05397: silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old
05398: man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
05399: way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
05400: these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because
05401: to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory
05402: heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony
05403: step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of
05404: sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;
05405: and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from
05406: taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,
05407: with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if
05408: Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say
05409: nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
05410: something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
05411: insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know
05412: Ahab then.
05413: 
05414: “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
05415: fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;
05416: where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
05417: last.—Down, dog, and kennel!”
05418: 
05419: Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
05420: scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
05421: “I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
05422: like it, sir.”
05423: 
05424: “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
05425: as if to avoid some passionate temptation.
05426: 
05427: “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be
05428: called a dog, sir.”
05429: 
05430: “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,
05431: or I’ll clear the world of thee!”
05432: 
05433: As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
05434: in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
05435: 
05436: “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,”
05437: muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s
05438: very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go
05439: back and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for
05440: him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
05441: first time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer
05442: too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb
05443: ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is
05444: he mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be
05445: something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,
05446: more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then.
05447: Didn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always
05448: finds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the
05449: sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and
05450: the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
05451: it? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a
05452: conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a
05453: toothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me
05454: from catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the
05455: after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s
05456: that for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in
05457: the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old
05458: game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be
05459: born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think
05460: of it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of
05461: queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.
05462: But that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh
05463: commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again.
05464: But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times
05465: a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as
05466: well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I
05467: didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It
05468: flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
05469: don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort
05470: of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,
05471: though—How? how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to
05472: hammock again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling
05473: thinks over by daylight.”
05474: 
05475: 
05476: CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
05477: 
05478: When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
05479: bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
05480: sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
05481: his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool
05482: on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.
05483: 
05484: In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
05485: fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could
05486: one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
05487: bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,
05488: and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
05489: 
05490: Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth
05491: in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How
05492: now,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no
05493: longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
05494: gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
05495: ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
05496: such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were
05497: the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this
05498: pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white
05499: vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like
05500: mine. I’ll smoke no more—”
05501: 
05502: He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
05503: waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
05504: made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
05505: 
05506: 
05507: CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
05508: 
05509: Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
05510: 
05511: “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s
05512: ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
05513: kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And
05514: then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept
05515: kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how
05516: curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow
05517: seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an
05518: insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not
05519: a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between
05520: a living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the
05521: hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.
05522: The living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And
05523: thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly
05524: toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it
05525: all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg
05526: now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a
05527: playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a
05528: base kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the
05529: foot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed
05530: farmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is
05531: whittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the
05532: dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
05533: badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
05534: shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!
05535: man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was
05536: over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business
05537: is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a
05538: kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
05539: round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
05540: had for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his
05541: stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on
05542: second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’
05543: said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of
05544: eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to
05545: stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as
05546: well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my
05547: foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,
05548: ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s
05549: argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’
05550: says I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory
05551: leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise
05552: Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good
05553: will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you
05554: were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s
05555: an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England
05556: the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and
05557: made garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were
05558: kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_
05559: kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;
05560: for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’
05561: With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
05562: swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
05563: hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”
05564: 
05565: “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
05566: 
05567: “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
05568: standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing
05569: you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
05570: whatever he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”
05571: 
05572: “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
05573: 
05574: “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
05575: 
05576: “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of
05577: something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
05578: Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.
05579: Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.”
05580: 
05581: 
05582: CHAPTER 32. Cetology.
05583: 
05584: Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
05585: in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere
05586: the Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of
05587: the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter
05588: almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the
05589: more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which
05590: are to follow.
05591: 
05592: It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
05593: that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
05594: classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
05595: essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.
05596: 
05597: “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
05598: Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
05599: 
05600: “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry
05601: as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.
05602: * * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal”
05603: (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
05604: 
05605: “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”
05606: “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field
05607: strewn with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to
05608: torture us naturalists.”
05609: 
05610: Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
05611: those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
05612: knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
05613: some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are
05614: the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
05615: large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors
05616: of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;
05617: Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
05618: Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick
05619: Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;
05620: the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to
05621: what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above
05622: cited extracts will show.
05623: 
05624: Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
05625: ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
05626: harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate
05627: subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
05628: authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
05629: sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy
05630: mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper
05631: upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of
05632: the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
05633: profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
05634: then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
05635: this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
05636: and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference
05637: to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past
05638: days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was
05639: to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a
05640: new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the
05641: Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!
05642: 
05643: There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
05644: living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
05645: degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s;
05646: both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both
05647: exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to
05648: be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,
05649: it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific
05650: description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,
05651: lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted
05652: whales, his is an unwritten life.
05653: 
05654: Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
05655: comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
05656: present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
05657: laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
05658: hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;
05659: because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
05660: reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
05661: description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much
05662: of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of
05663: a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.
05664: 
05665: But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
05666: Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea
05667: after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,
05668: ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I
05669: that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful
05670: tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a
05671: covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam
05672: through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with
05673: whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There
05674: are some preliminaries to settle.
05675: 
05676: First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
05677: is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
05678: still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of
05679: Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from
05680: the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,
05681: sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict,
05682: were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
05683: Leviathan.
05684: 
05685: The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from
05686: the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
05687: heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
05688: intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
05689: meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
05690: Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
05691: they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
05692: insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
05693: 
05694: Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
05695: ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
05696: This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
05697: respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given
05698: you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
05699: whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
05700: 
05701: Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
05702: conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
05703: whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.
05704: However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
05705: meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
05706: fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is
05707: still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have
05708: noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
05709: vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
05710: though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
05711: position.
05712: 
05713: By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
05714: from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
05715: with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
05716: hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
05717: alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
05718: must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the
05719: grand divisions of the entire whale host.
05720: 
05721: *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
05722: Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
05723: included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish
05724: are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,
05725: and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny
05726: their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their
05727: passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.
05728: 
05729: First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary
05730: BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
05731: all, both small and large.
05732: 
05733: I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
05734: 
05735: As the type of the FOLIO I present the _Sperm Whale_; of the OCTAVO,
05736: the _Grampus_; of the DUODECIMO, the _Porpoise_.
05737: 
05738: FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The
05739: _Sperm Whale_; II. the _Right Whale_; III. the _Fin-Back Whale_; IV.
05740: the _Hump-backed Whale_; V. the _Razor Back Whale_; VI. the _Sulphur
05741: Bottom Whale_.
05742: 
05743: BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).—This whale, among the
05744: English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
05745: whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
05746: French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the
05747: Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
05748: the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
05749: aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the
05750: only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
05751: obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
05752: upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically
05753: considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was
05754: almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
05755: was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
05756: spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
05757: creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland
05758: or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was
05759: that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable
05760: of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was
05761: exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
05762: and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you
05763: nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of
05764: time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was
05765: still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
05766: notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation
05767: must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this
05768: spermaceti was really derived.
05769: 
05770: BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is
05771: the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
05772: hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
05773: baleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article
05774: in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by
05775: all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black
05776: Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a
05777: deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus
05778: multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in
05779: the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the
05780: English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the
05781: Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the
05782: Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been
05783: hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale
05784: which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on
05785: the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of
05786: the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
05787: 
05788: Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
05789: English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree
05790: in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
05791: determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
05792: endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
05793: some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.
05794: The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with
05795: reference to elucidating the sperm whale.
05796: 
05797: BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon
05798: a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
05799: Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
05800: whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
05801: Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and
05802: in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
05803: portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great
05804: lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting
05805: folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,
05806: from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin
05807: is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder
05808: part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed
05809: end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,
05810: this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the
05811: surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with
05812: spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows
05813: upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
05814: circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and
05815: wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
05816: back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some
05817: men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly
05818: rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his
05819: straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear
05820: upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in
05821: swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems
05822: the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark
05823: that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the
05824: Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic
05825: species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of
05826: these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several
05827: varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales
05828: and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
05829: whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.
05830: 
05831: In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of
05832: great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
05833: convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
05834: in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded
05835: upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that
05836: those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to
05837: afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other
05838: detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.
05839: How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
05840: peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
05841: without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in
05842: other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the
05843: humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.
05844: Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these
05845: has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the
05846: same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,
05847: they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of
05848: them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all
05849: general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one
05850: of the whale-naturalists has split.
05851: 
05852: But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
05853: whale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
05854: right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
05855: Greenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have
05856: seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
05857: Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various
05858: leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
05859: available to the systematizer as those external ones already
05860: enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales
05861: bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.
05862: And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only
05863: one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.
05864: 
05865: BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen
05866: on the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,
05867: and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
05868: you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the
05869: popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
05870: sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very
05871: valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
05872: all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
05873: other of them.
05874: 
05875: BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is
05876: known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
05877: retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
05878: coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
05879: rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor
05880: does anybody else.
05881: 
05882: BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring
05883: gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
05884: Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;
05885: at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and
05886: then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is
05887: never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are
05888: told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true
05889: of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.
05890: 
05891: Thus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II. (_Octavo_).
05892: 
05893: OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which
05894: present may be numbered:—I., the _Grampus_; II., the _Black Fish_;
05895: III., the _Narwhale_; IV., the _Thrasher_; V., the _Killer_.
05896: 
05897: *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
05898: Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of
05899: the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
05900: in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form
05901: does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume
05902: does.
05903: 
05904: BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose
05905: loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
05906: landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
05907: popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand
05908: distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised
05909: him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to
05910: twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the
05911: waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil
05912: is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some
05913: fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the
05914: great sperm whale.
05915: 
05916: BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).—I give the popular
05917: fishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
05918: Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
05919: suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,
05920: because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the
05921: Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
05922: circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
05923: carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
05924: averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
05925: all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
05926: in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
05927: profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the
05928: Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic
05929: employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and
05930: quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.
05931: Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
05932: upwards of thirty gallons of oil.
05933: 
05934: BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril
05935: whale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose
05936: from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The
05937: creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
05938: feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly
05939: speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw
05940: in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found
05941: on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
05942: something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What
05943: precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
05944: say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
05945: bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for
05946: a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin
05947: said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the
05948: surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
05949: horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these
05950: surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided
05951: horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would
05952: certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
05953: The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,
05954: and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the
05955: Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From
05956: certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
05957: sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
05958: against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.
05959: It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same
05960: way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
05961: Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.
05962: Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that
05963: voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him
05964: from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the
05965: Thames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black
05966: Letter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long
05967: horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle
05968: at Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on
05969: bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,
05970: pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.
05971: 
05972: The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
05973: milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
05974: His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
05975: and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
05976: 
05977: BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).—Of this whale little is
05978: precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
05979: naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say
05980: that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of
05981: Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
05982: hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.
05983: The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.
05984: Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the
05985: ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on
05986: sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.
05987: 
05988: BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous
05989: for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He
05990: mounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by
05991: flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
05992: process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both
05993: are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.
05994: 
05995:  Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_).
05996: 
05997: DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.
05998: II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
05999: 
06000: To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
06001: possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
06002: feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular
06003: sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
06004: above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
06005: definition of what a whale is—_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal
06006: tail.
06007: 
06008: BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the
06009: common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
06010: bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
06011: must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always
06012: swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing
06013: themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their
06014: appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of
06015: fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.
06016: They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted
06017: a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
06018: these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly
06019: gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield
06020: you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid
06021: extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among
06022: jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat
06023: is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a
06024: porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
06025: readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;
06026: and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.
06027: 
06028: BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.
06029: Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
06030: larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.
06031: Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many
06032: times, but never yet saw him captured.
06033: 
06034: BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The
06035: largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it
06036: is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been
06037: designated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the
06038: circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In
06039: shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a
06040: less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
06041: gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises
06042: have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel
06043: hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his
06044: side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark
06045: in a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from
06046: stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.
06047: The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which
06048: makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a
06049: meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of
06050: the common porpoise.
06051: 
06052:   * * * * * *
06053: 
06054: Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
06055: Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the
06056: Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
06057: half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
06058: reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their
06059: fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
06060: future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If
06061: any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
06062: he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his
06063: Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk
06064: Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the
06065: Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;
06066: the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,
06067: Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists
06068: of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I
06069: omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them
06070: for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.
06071: 
06072: Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
06073: here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have
06074: kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
06075: unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
06076: crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small
06077: erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true
06078: ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever
06079: completing anything. This whole book is but a draught—nay, but the
06080: draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!
06081: 
06082: 
06083: CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
06084: 
06085: Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
06086: as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
06087: from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
06088: of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
06089: 
06090: The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced
06091: by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
06092: and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the
06093: person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
06094: officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;
06095: usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In
06096: those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation
06097: and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
06098: department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer
06099: reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted
06100: title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but
06101: his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as
06102: senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more
06103: inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
06104: harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
06105: in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the
06106: boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling
06107: ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand
06108: political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart
06109: from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
06110: professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
06111: their social equal.
06112: 
06113: Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
06114: this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
06115: merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
06116: so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
06117: the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in
06118: the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with
06119: it.
06120: 
06121: Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest
06122: of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
06123: the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
06124: or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
06125: common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
06126: hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a
06127: less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
06128: how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
06129: primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
06130: externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
06131: and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
06132: which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
06133: grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as
06134: much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
06135: shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
06136: 
06137: And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
06138: given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage
06139: he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he
06140: required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the
06141: quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
06142: circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
06143: addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in
06144: terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means
06145: unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.
06146: 
06147: Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
06148: those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
06149: incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
06150: they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of
06151: his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;
06152: through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an
06153: irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what
06154: it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over
06155: other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and
06156: entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.
06157: This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from
06158: the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can
06159: give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite
06160: inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than
06161: through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.
06162: Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political
06163: superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot
06164: imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of
06165: Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an
06166: imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the
06167: tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
06168: depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,
06169: ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one
06170: now alluded to.
06171: 
06172: But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
06173: grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
06174: Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
06175: whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
06176: and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
06177: must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
06178: featured in the unbodied air!
06179: 
06180: 
06181: CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
06182: 
06183: It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
06184: loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord
06185: and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking
06186: an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on
06187: the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
06188: the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the
06189: tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But
06190: presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the
06191: deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.
06192: Starbuck,” disappears into the cabin.
06193: 
06194: When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,
06195: the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
06196: Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,
06197: and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of
06198: pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second
06199: Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the
06200: main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important
06201: rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,
06202: Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.
06203: 
06204: But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
06205: seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
06206: sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
06207: shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
06208: over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
06209: his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
06210: far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
06211: processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into
06212: the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
06213: then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,
06214: in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.
06215: 
06216: It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
06217: artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
06218: some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
06219: defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
06220: very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
06221: same commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
06222: deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the
06223: table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
06224: difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of
06225: Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
06226: therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he
06227: who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
06228: private dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power
06229: and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty
06230: of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.
06231: Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.
06232: It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.
06233: Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
06234: ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
06235: peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
06236: 
06237: Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion
06238: on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
06239: deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
06240: served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,
06241: there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,
06242: their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved
06243: the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they
06244: would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
06245: upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his
06246: knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab
06247: thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his
06248: meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little
06249: started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed
06250: it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like
06251: the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
06252: profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals
06253: were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old
06254: Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief
06255: it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
06256: below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
06257: of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;
06258: his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
06259: himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the
06260: first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never
06261: more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
06262: nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask
06263: helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.
06264: Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he
06265: thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its
06266: clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so
06267: long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and
06268: therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!
06269: was a butterless man!
06270: 
06271: Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask
06272: is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly
06273: jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;
06274: and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb
06275: even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small
06276: appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask
06277: must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that
06278: day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the
06279: deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever
06280: since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he
06281: had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.
06282: For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal
06283: in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed
06284: from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
06285: old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before
06286: the mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of
06287: glory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any
06288: mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s
06289: official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
06290: vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
06291: through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
06292: awful Ahab.
06293: 
06294: Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
06295: in the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted
06296: order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
06297: restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the
06298: three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary
06299: legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and
06300: mighty cabin.
06301: 
06302: In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
06303: invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free
06304: license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior
06305: fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid
06306: of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed
06307: their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined
06308: like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading
06309: with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that
06310: to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale
06311: Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly
06312: quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he
06313: did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an
06314: ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,
06315: harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted
06316: Dough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head
06317: into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,
06318: began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was
06319: naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this
06320: bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital
06321: nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,
06322: and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,
06323: Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after
06324: seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he
06325: would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and
06326: fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was
06327: over.
06328: 
06329: It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
06330: his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on
06331: the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the
06332: low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low
06333: cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in
06334: a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
06335: not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
06336: small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so
06337: broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage
06338: fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through
06339: his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by
06340: beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a
06341: mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
06342: much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
06343: marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
06344: Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might
06345: be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery
06346: hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor
06347: did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for
06348: their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,
06349: they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did
06350: not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget
06351: that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
06352: guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!
06353: hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin
06354: should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his
06355: great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to
06356: his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling
06357: in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
06358: 
06359: But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
06360: there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
06361: scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
06362: when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
06363: 
06364: In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
06365: captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
06366: the ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
06367: anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,
06368: the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to
06369: have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it
06370: was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a
06371: moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
06372: residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
06373: was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally
06374: included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He
06375: lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled
06376: Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan
06377: of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the
06378: winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old
06379: age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed
06380: upon the sullen paws of its gloom!
06381: 
06382: 
06383: CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
06384: 
06385: It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
06386: other seamen my first mast-head came round.
06387: 
06388: In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
06389: simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may
06390: have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
06391: cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she
06392: is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial
06393: even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
06394: skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
06395: relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
06396: 
06397: Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
06398: very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
06399: here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
06400: Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.
06401: For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by
06402: their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,
06403: or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
06404: stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the
06405: dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel
06406: builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a
06407: nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general
06408: belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for
06409: astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar
06410: stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with
06411: prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were
06412: wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the
06413: look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing
06414: in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,
06415: who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
06416: latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the
06417: ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a
06418: dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
06419: place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
06420: everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
06421: standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
06422: and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
06423: are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
06424: discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of
06425: the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and
06426: fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
06427: whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great
06428: Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
06429: Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that
06430: point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral
06431: Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
06432: Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,
06433: token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
06434: smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
06435: Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
06436: befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
06437: however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the
06438: thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be
06439: shunned.
06440: 
06441: It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
06442: standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not
06443: so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
06444: historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,
06445: that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
06446: launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected
06447: lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by
06448: means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.
06449: A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New
06450: Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned
06451: boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we
06452: then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The
06453: three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen
06454: taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other
06455: every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly
06456: pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is
06457: delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,
06458: striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while
06459: beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters
06460: of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous
06461: Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of
06462: the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
06463: indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
06464: into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
06465: uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
06466: with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
06467: unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
06468: securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what
06469: you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more
06470: are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
06471: 
06472: In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’
06473: voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
06474: mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be
06475: deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
06476: of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of
06477: anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
06478: comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
06479: a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
06480: and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your
06481: most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you
06482: stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)
06483: called the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the
06484: beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To
06485: be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in
06486: the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest
06487: watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul
06488: is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about
06489: in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing
06490: (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a
06491: watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or
06492: additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of
06493: drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
06494: your watch-coat.
06495: 
06496: Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
06497: southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
06498: pulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland
06499: whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In
06500: the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
06501: Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
06502: re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this
06503: admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
06504: charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
06505: _crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s
06506: good craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of
06507: himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all
06508: ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
06509: after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and
06510: patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other
06511: apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something
06512: like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is
06513: furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head
06514: in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into
06515: it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or
06516: side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker
06517: underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather
06518: rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and
06519: other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his
06520: mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a
06521: rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask
06522: and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or
06523: vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
06524: successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
06525: water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it
06526: was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,
06527: all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he
06528: so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
06529: scientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small
06530: compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors
06531: resulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle
06532: magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in
06533: the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having
06534: been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though
06535: the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his
06536: learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and
06537: “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was
06538: not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail
06539: being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little
06540: case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within
06541: easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and
06542: even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it
06543: very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,
06544: seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while
06545: with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics
06546: aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the
06547: pole.
06548: 
06549: But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
06550: Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
06551: greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
06552: seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used
06553: to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
06554: chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;
06555: then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
06556: top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so
06557: at last mount to my ultimate destination.
06558: 
06559: Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
06560: but sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how
06561: could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
06562: altitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
06563: whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out
06564: every time.”
06565: 
06566: And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
06567: Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
06568: lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
06569: offers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware
06570: of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be
06571: killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes
06572: round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor
06573: are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery
06574: furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
06575: young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
06576: sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
06577: himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,
06578: and in moody phrase ejaculates:—
06579: 
06580: 
06581: “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
06582: blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”
06583: 
06584: 
06585: 
06586: Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
06587: philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
06588: “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
06589: to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
06590: rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young
06591: Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are
06592: short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have
06593: left their opera-glasses at home.
06594: 
06595: “Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
06596: cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
06597: yet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”
06598: Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
06599: the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
06600: vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
06601: cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
06602: takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
06603: blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,
06604: half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
06605: dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him
06606: the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
06607: continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit
06608: ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;
06609: like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of
06610: every shore the round globe over.
06611: 
06612: There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
06613: gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
06614: the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on
06615: ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
06616: identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And
06617: perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled
06618: shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no
06619: more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!
06620: 
06621: 
06622: CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
06623: 
06624: (_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)
06625: 
06626: It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
06627: shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
06628: cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that
06629: hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in
06630: the garden.
06631: 
06632: Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
06633: rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
06634: dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
06635: you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
06636: you would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one
06637: unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
06638: 
06639: But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
06640: nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his
06641: thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
06642: main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
06643: turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
06644: possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of
06645: every outer movement.
06646: 
06647: “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks
06648: the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”
06649: 
06650: The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
06651: deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
06652: 
06653: It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the
06654: bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
06655: with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody
06656: aft.
06657: 
06658: “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
06659: ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
06660: 
06661: “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
06662: 
06663: When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
06664: wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
06665: the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
06666: glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
06667: started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
06668: resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched
06669: hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
06670: the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have
06671: summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.
06672: But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—
06673: 
06674: “What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
06675: 
06676: “Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
06677: voices.
06678: 
06679: “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
06680: hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
06681: thrown them.
06682: 
06683: “And what do ye next, men?”
06684: 
06685: “Lower away, and after him!”
06686: 
06687: “And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
06688: 
06689: “A dead whale or a stove boat!”
06690: 
06691: More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
06692: countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
06693: gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
06694: themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
06695: 
06696: But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
06697: pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
06698: almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—
06699: 
06700: “All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
06701: whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
06702: broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye
06703: see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
06704: 
06705: While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
06706: slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
06707: to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly
06708: humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
06709: inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
06710: vitality in him.
06711: 
06712: Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
06713: with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
06714: other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises
06715: me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
06716: whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
06717: punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
06718: that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”
06719: 
06720: “Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
06721: hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
06722: 
06723: “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the
06724: topmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
06725: white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”
06726: 
06727: All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
06728: more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of
06729: the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
06730: separately touched by some specific recollection.
06731: 
06732: “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that
06733: some call Moby Dick.”
06734: 
06735: “Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
06736: 
06737: “Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the
06738: Gay-Header deliberately.
06739: 
06740: “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a
06741: parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
06742: 
06743: “And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
06744: Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
06745: him—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
06746: round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
06747: 
06748: “Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
06749: and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
06750: shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the
06751: great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
06752: split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have
06753: seen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”
06754: 
06755: “Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
06756: been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
06757: struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain
06758: Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off
06759: thy leg?”
06760: 
06761: “Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
06762: hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
06763: brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted
06764: with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
06765: “Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor
06766: pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with
06767: measureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him
06768: round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,
06769: and round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye
06770: have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,
06771: and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin
06772: out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do
06773: look brave.”
06774: 
06775: “Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
06776: excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
06777: Moby Dick!”
06778: 
06779: “God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,
06780: men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long
06781: face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
06782: game for Moby Dick?”
06783: 
06784: “I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
06785: Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
06786: came here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many
06787: barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain
06788: Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”
06789: 
06790: “Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
06791: little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the
06792: accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
06793: girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
06794: let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”
06795: 
06796: “He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it
06797: rings most vast, but hollow.”
06798: 
06799: “Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee
06800: from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,
06801: Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”
06802: 
06803: “Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
06804: are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the
06805: undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
06806: the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man
06807: will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
06808: outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
06809: that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.
06810: But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous
06811: strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable
06812: thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the
06813: white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me
06814: of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the
06815: sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of
06816: fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my
06817: master, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no
06818: confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is
06819: a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted
06820: thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that
06821: thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small
06822: indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder
06823: Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by
06824: the sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,
06825: that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
06826: The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this
06827: matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he
06828: snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one
06829: tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to
06830: help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From
06831: this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely
06832: he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a
06833: whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!
06834: Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.
06835: (_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in
06836: his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without
06837: rebellion.”
06838: 
06839: “God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.
06840: 
06841: But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
06842: did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
06843: hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor
06844: yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
06845: their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up
06846: with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the
06847: winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as
06848: before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?
06849: But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so
06850: much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things
06851: within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost
06852: necessities in our being, these still drive us on.
06853: 
06854: “The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.
06855: 
06856: Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
06857: ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him
06858: near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
06859: mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s
06860: company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
06861: searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,
06862: as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their
06863: leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,
06864: alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.
06865: 
06866: “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
06867: nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
06868: draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes
06869: round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
06870: serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
06871: way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
06872: brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
06873: 
06874: “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and
06875: ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
06876: with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
06877: sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,
06878: you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.
06879: Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not
06880: thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!
06881: 
06882: “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
06883: touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three
06884: level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
06885: suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
06886: Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some
06887: nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the
06888: same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own
06889: magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,
06890: and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest
06891: eye of Starbuck fell downright.
06892: 
06893: “In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but
06894: once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_
06895: had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped
06896: ye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do
06897: appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three
06898: most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain
06899: the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using
06900: his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
06901: _that_ shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your
06902: seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”
06903: 
06904: Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
06905: detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
06906: up, before him.
06907: 
06908: “Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye
06909: not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,
06910: advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith,
06911: slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
06912: sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.
06913: 
06914: “Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
06915: them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
06916: Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
06917: it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the
06918: deathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do
06919: not hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were
06920: lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the
06921: spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,
06922: and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished
06923: pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free
06924: hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.
06925: 
06926: 
06927: CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
06928: 
06929: _The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out_.
06930: 
06931: I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
06932: sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
06933: but first I pass.
06934: 
06935: Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
06936: The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
06937: down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,
06938: the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it
06939: bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
06940: darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that
06941: I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me
06942: so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
06943: mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
06944: 
06945: Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
06946: me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not
06947: me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted
06948: with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most
06949: subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good
06950: night—good night! (_waving his hand, he moves from the window_.)
06951: 
06952: ’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
06953: but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
06954: revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
06955: stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the
06956: match itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and
06957: what I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m
06958: demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to
06959: comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;
06960: and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my
06961: dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s
06962: more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye
06963: cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I
06964: will not say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own
06965: size; don’t pommel _me!_ No, ye’ve knocked me down, and I am up again;
06966: but _ye_ have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags!
06967: I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come
06968: and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye
06969: swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed
06970: purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
06971: Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
06972: torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, naught’s an
06973: angle to the iron way!
06974: 
06975: 
06976: CHAPTER 38. Dusk.
06977: 
06978: _By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it_.
06979: 
06980: My soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
06981: Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But
06982: he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I
06983: see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill
06984: I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have
06985: no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he
06986: would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!
06987: Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse
06988: yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe
06989: would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow
06990: wide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the
06991: small gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God
06992: may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole
06993: clock’s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to
06994: lift again.
06995: 
06996: [_A burst of revelry from the forecastle_.]
06997: 
06998: Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
06999: human mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white
07000: whale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is
07001: forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life.
07002: Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
07003: bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods
07004: within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake,
07005: and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills
07006: me through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in
07007: an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,—as wild,
07008: untutored things are forced to feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel
07009: the latent horror in thee! but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me!
07010: and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight
07011: ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye
07012: blessed influences!
07013: 
07014: 
07015: CHAPTER 39. First Night-Watch.
07016: 
07017: Fore-Top.
07018: 
07019: (_Stubb solus, and mending a brace_.)
07020: 
07021: Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever
07022: since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
07023: laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
07024: will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all
07025: predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor
07026: eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
07027: the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the
07028: gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon
07029: his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, _wise_ Stubb—that’s my title—well,
07030: Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be
07031: coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
07032: leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
07033: skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
07034: out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as
07035: a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—
07036: 
07037: 
07038: We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting
07039: As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim, And break on the lips while
07040: meeting.
07041: 
07042: 
07043: 
07044: A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)
07045: he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir,
07046: just through with this job—coming.
07047: 
07048: 
07049: CHAPTER 40. Midnight, Forecastle.
07050: 
07051: HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.
07052: 
07053: (_Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning,
07054: and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus_.)
07055: 
07056: 
07057:   Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies! Farewell and adieu to you,
07058:   ladies of Spain! Our captain’s commanded.—
07059: 
07060: 
07061: 
07062: 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the
07063: digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
07064: 
07065: (_Sings, and all follow._)
07066: 
07067: 
07068:  Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of
07069:  those gallant whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your
07070:  boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we’ll have one of those
07071:  fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your
07072:  hearts never fail! While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!
07073: 
07074: 
07075: 
07076: MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
07077: 
07078: 2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear,
07079: bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me
07080: call the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,
07081: so, (_thrusts his head down the scuttle_,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
07082: Eight bells there below! Tumble up!
07083: 
07084: DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
07085: this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as
07086: filliping to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like
07087: ground-tier butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail
07088: ’em through it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em
07089: it’s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.
07090: That’s the way—_that’s_ it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating
07091: Amsterdam butter.
07092: 
07093: FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to
07094: anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand
07095: by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
07096: 
07097: PIP. (_Sulky and sleepy._) Don’t know where it is.
07098: 
07099: FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I
07100: say; merry’s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now,
07101: Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves!
07102: Legs! legs!
07103: 
07104: ICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my
07105: taste. I’m used to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the
07106: subject; but excuse me.
07107: 
07108: MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take
07109: his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners!
07110: I must have partners!
07111: 
07112: SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye; yea,
07113: turn grasshopper!
07114: 
07115: LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us.
07116: Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here
07117: comes the music; now for it!
07118: 
07119: AZORE SAILOR. (_Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the
07120: scuttle_.) Here you are, Pip; and there’s the windlass-bitts; up you
07121: mount! Now, boys! (_The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go
07122: below; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty_.)
07123: 
07124: AZORE SAILOR. (_Dancing_) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig
07125: it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!
07126: 
07127: PIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.
07128: 
07129: CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
07130: thyself.
07131: 
07132: FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through
07133: it! Split jibs! tear yourselves!
07134: 
07135: TASHTEGO. (_Quietly smoking._) That’s a white man; he calls that fun:
07136: humph! I save my sweat.
07137: 
07138: OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
07139: they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the
07140: bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
07141: corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled
07142: crews! Well, well; belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars
07143: have it; and so ’tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads,
07144: you’re young; I was once.
07145: 
07146: 3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after
07147: whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.
07148: 
07149: (_They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky
07150: darkens—the wind rises_.)
07151: 
07152: LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
07153: high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
07154: 
07155: MALTESE SAILOR. (_Reclining and shaking his cap_.) It’s the waves—the
07156: snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
07157: would all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with
07158: them evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match
07159: it!—as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
07160: over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
07161: 
07162: SICILIAN SAILOR. (_Reclining_.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet
07163: interlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip!
07164: heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
07165: else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (_Nudging_.)
07166: 
07167: TAHITAN SAILOR. (_Reclining on a mat_.) Hail, holy nakedness of our
07168: dancing girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I
07169: still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven
07170: in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn
07171: and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then,
07172: if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from
07173: Pirohitee’s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the
07174: villages?—The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (_Leaps to his
07175: feet_.)
07176: 
07177: PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand
07178: by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
07179: they’ll go lunging presently.
07180: 
07181: DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
07182: holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more
07183: afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic
07184: with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
07185: 
07186: 4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
07187: tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
07188: waterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!
07189: 
07190: ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the
07191: lads to hunt him up his whale!
07192: 
07193: ALL. Aye! aye!
07194: 
07195: OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort
07196: of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none
07197: but the crew’s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort
07198: of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at
07199: sea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another
07200: in the sky—lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.
07201: 
07202: DAGGOO. What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m
07203: quarried out of it!
07204: 
07205: SPANISH SAILOR. (_Aside_.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes
07206: me touchy (_Advancing_.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable
07207: dark side of mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.
07208: 
07209: DAGGOO (_grimly_). None.
07210: 
07211: ST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or
07212: else in his one case our old Mogul’s fire-waters are somewhat long in
07213: working.
07214: 
07215: 5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What’s that I saw—lightning? Yes.
07216: 
07217: SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.
07218: 
07219: DAGGOO (_springing_). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!
07220: 
07221: SPANISH SAILOR (_meeting him_). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small
07222: spirit!
07223: 
07224: ALL. A row! a row! a row!
07225: 
07226: TASHTEGO (_with a whiff_). A row a’low, and a row aloft—Gods and
07227: men—both brawlers! Humph!
07228: 
07229: BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row!
07230: Plunge in with ye!
07231: 
07232: ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard’s knife! A ring, a ring!
07233: 
07234: OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring

07244: Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower,
07245: Pip, here comes the royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled
07246: woods, the last day of the year! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now?
07247: But there they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to
07248: ’em; they’re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a
07249: squall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white
07250: squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I
07251: heard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but
07252: spoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like
07253: my tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh,
07254: thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on
07255: this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no
07256: bowels to feel fear!

07258: 
07259: CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
07260: 
07261: I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
07262: my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more
07263: did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A
07264: wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud
07265: seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous
07266: monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of
07267: violence and revenge.
07268: 
07269: For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
07270: secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
07271: frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of
07272: his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
07273: him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
07274: battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of
07275: whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
07276: watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest
07277: along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
07278: or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any
07279: sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity
07280: of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,
07281: direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole
07282: world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings
07283: concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels
07284: reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or
07285: such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,
07286: which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
07287: completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair
07288: presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other
07289: than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked
07290: by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and
07291: malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by
07292: accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,
07293: for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
07294: more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,
07295: than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous
07296: encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly
07297: regarded.
07298: 
07299: And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
07300: caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one
07301: of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any
07302: other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue
07303: in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken
07304: limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of
07305: fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and
07306: piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake
07307: the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White
07308: Whale had eventually come.
07309: 
07310: Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
07311: horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
07312: fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
07313: terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
07314: maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
07315: abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.
07316: And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
07317: surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
07318: fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
07319: are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and
07320: superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they
07321: are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is
07322: appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its
07323: greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such
07324: remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
07325: thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or
07326: aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and
07327: longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is
07328: wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many
07329: a mighty birth.
07330: 
07331: No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
07332: the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in
07333: the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
07334: half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
07335: eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
07336: that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally
07337: strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White
07338: Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
07339: jaw.
07340: 
07341: But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
07342: Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm
07343: Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
07344: leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are
07345: those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
07346: enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
07347: perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
07348: timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
07349: are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
07350: sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered
07351: the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
07352: restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
07353: seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
07354: fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
07355: whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale
07356: anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows
07357: which stem him.
07358: 
07359: And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
07360: times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
07361: naturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to
07362: be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be
07363: so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.
07364: Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost
07365: similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron
07366: himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks
07367: included) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the
07368: precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
07369: such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general
07370: experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in
07371: their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the
07372: superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their
07373: vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
07374: 
07375: So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
07376: of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
07377: of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
07378: practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
07379: warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
07380: hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
07381: as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be
07382: inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are
07383: some remarkable documents that may be consulted.
07384: 
07385: Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
07386: were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
07387: chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
07388: specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
07389: accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
07390: offered.
07391: 
07392: One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
07393: with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was
07394: the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
07395: actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
07396: instant of time.
07397: 
07398: Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
07399: altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as
07400: the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,
07401: even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm
07402: Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to
07403: his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious
07404: and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning
07405: the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he
07406: transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant
07407: points.
07408: 
07409: It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
07410: as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,
07411: that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose
07412: bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland
07413: seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
07414: been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
07415: not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been
07416: believed by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a
07417: problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the
07418: real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old
07419: times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there
07420: was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the
07421: surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain
07422: near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy
07423: Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost
07424: fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.
07425: 
07426: Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
07427: knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
07428: escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen
07429: should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not
07430: only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in
07431: time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he
07432: would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to
07433: spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for
07434: again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied
07435: jet would once more be seen.
07436: 
07437: But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
07438: the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
07439: the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his
07440: uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
07441: but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
07442: forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent
07443: features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
07444: revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
07445: 
07446: The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
07447: same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
07448: appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
07449: his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
07450: sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
07451: gleamings.
07452: 
07453: Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
07454: deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
07455: terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
07456: specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.
07457: More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
07458: perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,
07459: with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known
07460: to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
07461: boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.
07462: 
07463: Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
07464: disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in
07465: the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s
07466: infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
07467: that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
07468: unintelligent agent.
07469: 
07470: Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
07471: his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
07472: boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
07473: white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
07474: sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
07475: 
07476: His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
07477: eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
07478: dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
07479: seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
07480: whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping
07481: his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away
07482: Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,
07483: no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming
07484: malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that
07485: almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness
07486: against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness
07487: he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but
07488: all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam
07489: before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious
07490: agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left
07491: living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity
07492: which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern
07493: Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of
07494: the east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and
07495: worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the
07496: abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All
07497: that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;
07498: all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
07499: brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy
07500: Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby
07501: Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general
07502: rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if
07503: his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.
07504: 
07505: It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
07506: the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the
07507: monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
07508: corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
07509: probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
07510: Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
07511: months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in
07512: one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian
07513: Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
07514: another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on
07515: the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania
07516: seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals
07517: during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a
07518: leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was
07519: moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to
07520: lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a
07521: strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when
07522: running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails
07523: spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,
07524: the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn
07525: swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and
07526: air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
07527: and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
07528: direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,
07529: raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
07530: When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some
07531: still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
07532: contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
07533: narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his
07534: narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been
07535: left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural
07536: intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living
07537: instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy
07538: stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its
07539: concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost
07540: his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold
07541: more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one
07542: reasonable object.
07543: 
07544: This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
07545: But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding
07546: far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where
07547: we here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your
07548: way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
07549: where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root
07550: of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
07551: buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken
07552: throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he
07553: patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
07554: ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that
07555: proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young
07556: exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old
07557: State-secret come.
07558: 
07559: Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means
07560: are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or
07561: change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
07562: dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling
07563: was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
07564: Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
07565: with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
07566: otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the
07567: terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
07568: 
07569: The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
07570: ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
07571: always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the
07572: present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,
07573: that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
07574: account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
07575: isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons
07576: he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
07577: of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and
07578: scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
07579: idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
07580: his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
07581: Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
07582: yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
07583: his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,
07584: that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
07585: him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one
07586: only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one
07587: of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking
07588: in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
07589: wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on
07590: profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
07591: mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
07592: revenge.
07593: 
07594: Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses
07595: a Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
07596: up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled
07597: also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
07598: Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
07599: Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so
07600: officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality
07601: to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so
07602: aboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their
07603: souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the
07604: White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to
07605: be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious
07606: understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have
07607: seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to
07608: explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean
07609: miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by
07610: the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the
07611: irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
07612: still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the
07613: place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
07614: naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
07615: 
07616: 
07617: CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
07618: 
07619: What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
07620: was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
07621: 
07622: Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
07623: could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there
07624: was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
07625: which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;
07626: and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost
07627: despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of
07628: the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to
07629: explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I
07630: must, else all these chapters might be naught.
07631: 
07632: Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
07633: as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
07634: japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
07635: recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,
07636: grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants”
07637: above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the
07638: modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the
07639: royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a
07640: snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to
07641: overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;
07642: and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,
07643: giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and
07644: though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of
07645: gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and
07646: though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is
07647: made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides,
07648: the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of
07649: the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in
07650: many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of
07651: the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn
07652: by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
07653: august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
07654: and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame
07655: being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,
07656: Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and
07657: though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred
07658: White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that
07659: spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send
07660: to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and
07661: though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
07662: derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
07663: worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
07664: faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
07665: our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to
07666: the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white
07667: before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there
07668: white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with
07669: whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an
07670: elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more
07671: of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.
07672: 
07673: This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
07674: divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
07675: terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
07676: Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the
07677: tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
07678: transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which
07679: imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,
07680: to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged
07681: tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded
07682: bear or shark.*
07683: 
07684: *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
07685: would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
07686: whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
07687: hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
07688: it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
07689: irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
07690: fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
07691: two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us
07692: with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;
07693: yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
07694: terror.
07695: 
07696: As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
07697: creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
07698: same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
07699: hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish
07700: mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence
07701: _Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.
07702: Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,
07703: and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.
07704: 
07705: Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
07706: wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
07707: imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
07708: unflattering laureate, Nature.*
07709: 
07710: *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
07711: gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
07712: below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the
07713: main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
07714: with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its
07715: vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
07716: flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
07717: cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its
07718: inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took
07719: hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white
07720: thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
07721: waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
07722: towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only
07723: hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and
07724: turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
07725: never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
07726: thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
07727: learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no
07728: possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
07729: those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon
07730: our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to
07731: be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a
07732: little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
07733: 
07734: I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
07735: chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
07736: this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
07737: albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such
07738: emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.
07739: 
07740: But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will
07741: tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
07742: At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
07743: tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting
07744: it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
07745: taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,
07746: the invoking, and adoring cherubim!
07747: 
07748: Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
07749: White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
07750: large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
07751: thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the
07752: elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
07753: days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At
07754: their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
07755: every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his
07756: mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
07757: resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A
07758: most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
07759: world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
07760: glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,
07761: bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid
07762: his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
07763: streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
07764: circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White
07765: Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through
07766: his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to
07767: the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.
07768: Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this
07769: noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so
07770: clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it
07771: which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain
07772: nameless terror.
07773: 
07774: But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
07775: accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
07776: Albatross.
07777: 
07778: What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
07779: the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
07780: that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he
07781: bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive
07782: deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
07783: more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be
07784: so?
07785: 
07786: Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not
07787: the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
07788: crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the
07789: gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
07790: Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
07791: omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of
07792: that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
07793: faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the
07794: market-place!
07795: 
07796: Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
07797: mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It
07798: cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
07799: the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
07800: there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
07801: consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And
07802: from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
07803: shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail
07804: to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in
07805: a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that
07806: even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on
07807: his pallid horse.
07808: 
07809: Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
07810: thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
07811: idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
07812: 
07813: But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
07814: account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by
07815: the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
07816: whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
07817: of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
07818: but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however
07819: modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
07820: to the hidden cause we seek?
07821: 
07822: Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
07823: and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
07824: though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
07825: to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
07826: entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able
07827: to recall them now.
07828: 
07829: Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
07830: acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
07831: mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
07832: speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
07833: with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of
07834: the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White
07835: Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
07836: 
07837: Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
07838: kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower
07839: of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
07840: untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
07841: neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer
07842: towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar
07843: moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
07844: mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is
07845: full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all
07846: latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a
07847: spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with
07848: mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,
07849: followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a
07850: wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in
07851: reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man”
07852: of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides
07853: through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than
07854: all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
07855: 
07856: Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
07857: earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
07858: tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
07859: field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
07860: (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
07861: house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it
07862: is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,
07863: saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and
07864: there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,
07865: this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful
07866: greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
07867: pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.
07868: 
07869: I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
07870: is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
07871: objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
07872: aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
07873: almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
07874: exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
07875: universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
07876: respectively elucidated by the following examples.
07877: 
07878: First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
07879: by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
07880: just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
07881: precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to
07882: view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if
07883: from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming
07884: round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
07885: phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in
07886: vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
07887: they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.
07888: Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much
07889: the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous
07890: whiteness that so stirred me?”
07891: 
07892: Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
07893: snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
07894: mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
07895: altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
07896: lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
07897: backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
07898: unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
07899: to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding
07900: the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal
07901: trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and
07902: half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his
07903: misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with
07904: its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.
07905: 
07906: But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
07907: but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
07908: hypo, Ishmael.
07909: 
07910: Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
07911: Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the
07912: sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
07913: he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
07914: will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in
07915: phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of
07916: wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange
07917: muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the
07918: experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,
07919: of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
07920: 
07921: No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
07922: knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
07923: Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring
07924: bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
07925: prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.
07926: 
07927: Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
07928: the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
07929: windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking
07930: of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
07931: 
07932: Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
07933: sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
07934: those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible
07935: world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in
07936: fright.
07937: 
07938: But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
07939: learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
07940: and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
07941: meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
07942: Christian’s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
07943: in things the most appalling to mankind.
07944: 
07945: Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
07946: and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
07947: thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
07948: way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
07949: the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
07950: colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,
07951: full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour
07952: of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory
07953: of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately
07954: or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
07955: and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
07956: young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
07957: in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified
07958: Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover
07959: nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and
07960: consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her
07961: hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless
07962: in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all
07963: objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all
07964: this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
07965: travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
07966: glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at
07967: the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And
07968: of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at
07969: the fiery hunt?
07970: 
07971: 
07972: CHAPTER 43. Hark!
07973: 
07974: “HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
07975: 
07976: It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in
07977: a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to
07978: the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the
07979: buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the
07980: hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak
07981: or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the
07982: deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the
07983: steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
07984: 
07985: It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
07986: whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
07987: Cholo, the words above.
07988: 
07989: “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
07990: 
07991: “Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
07992: 
07993: “There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it
07994: sounded like a cough.”
07995: 
07996: “Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
07997: 
07998: “There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning
07999: over, now!”
08000: 
08001: “Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits
08002: ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the
08003: bucket!”
08004: 
08005: “Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
08006: 
08007: “Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old
08008: Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re
08009: the chap.”
08010: 
08011: “Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
08012: down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I
08013: suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell
08014: Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the
08015: wind.”
08016: 
08017: “Tish! the bucket!”
08018: 
08019: 
08020: CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
08021: 
08022: Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
08023: took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
08024: purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
08025: transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
08026: charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating
08027: himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various
08028: lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady
08029: pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At
08030: intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein
08031: were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former
08032: voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.
08033: 
08034: While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
08035: head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever
08036: threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till
08037: it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and
08038: courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing
08039: lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
08040: 
08041: But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
08042: cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
08043: brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
08044: others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before
08045: him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to
08046: the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
08047: 
08048: Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
08049: it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
08050: creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem
08051: to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby
08052: calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling
08053: to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
08054: latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
08055: certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that
08056: ground in search of his prey.
08057: 
08058: So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
08059: sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
08060: that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
08061: were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
08062: collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
08063: correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
08064: flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct
08065: elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*
08066: 
08067: 
08068:   *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
08069:   an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
08070:   Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it
08071:   appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
08072:   portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the
08073:   ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of
08074:   longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
08075:   columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which
08076:   districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have
08077:   been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to
08078:   show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been
08079:   seen.”
08080: 
08081: 
08082: 
08083: 
08084: Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
08085: sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
08086: intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;
08087: continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
08088: exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one
08089: tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
08090: direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,
08091: and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
08092: unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these
08093: times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
08094: (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but
08095: never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when
08096: circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
08097: particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating
08098: whales may with great confidence be looked for.
08099: 
08100: And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
08101: feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
08102: the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
08103: art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be
08104: wholly without prospect of a meeting.
08105: 
08106: There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
08107: delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,
08108: perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
08109: for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
08110: herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
08111: say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were
08112: found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and
08113: unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In
08114: general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the
08115: solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that
08116: though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what
08117: is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on
08118: the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to
08119: visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she
08120: would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding
08121: grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed
08122: only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his
08123: places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing
08124: his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to
08125: whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a
08126: particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities
08127: would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every
08128: possibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and
08129: place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the
08130: Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,
08131: Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for
08132: awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted
08133: interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of
08134: the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the
08135: waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot
08136: where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his
08137: vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
08138: vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
08139: hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
08140: crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
08141: hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
08142: unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
08143: 
08144: Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
08145: Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her
08146: commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
08147: then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
08148: Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next
08149: ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,
08150: perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very
08151: complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and
08152: sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
08153: of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
08154: if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote
08155: from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
08156: off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any
08157: other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,
08158: Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,
08159: might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
08160: Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.
08161: 
08162: But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
08163: not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
08164: solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
08165: individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
08166: in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar
08167: snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be
08168: unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to
08169: himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
08170: would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?
08171: His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!
08172: And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a
08173: weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air
08174: of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what
08175: trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one
08176: unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes
08177: with his own bloody nails in his palms.
08178: 
08179: Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
08180: dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through
08181: the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
08182: round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing
08183: of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was
08184: sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up
08185: from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked
08186: flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap
08187: down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild
08188: cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would
08189: burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on
08190: fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms
08191: of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the
08192: plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the
08193: scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab
08194: that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to
08195: burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living
08196: principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated
08197: from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its
08198: outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
08199: scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it
08200: was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless
08201: leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s
08202: case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme
08203: purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced
08204: itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
08205: being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common
08206: vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the
08207: unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that
08208: glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,
08209: was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,
08210: a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
08211: therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts
08212: have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus
08213: makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that
08214: vulture the very creature he creates.
08215: 
08216: 
08217: CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
08218: 
08219: So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
08220: as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
08221: particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
08222: its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
08223: volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
08224: more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
08225: and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of
08226: the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity
08227: of the main points of this affair.
08228: 
08229: I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
08230: content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
08231: items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
08232: these citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally
08233: follow of itself.
08234: 
08235: First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
08236: receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
08237: interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
08238: same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
08239: private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where
08240: three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I
08241: think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
08242: them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
08243: Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far
08244: into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
08245: often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with
08246: all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
08247: unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been
08248: on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
08249: brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.
08250: This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the
08251: other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;
08252: that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second
08253: attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,
08254: afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so
08255: fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the
08256: last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
08257: whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say
08258: three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three
08259: instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard
08260: of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there
08261: is no good ground to impeach.
08262: 
08263: Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
08264: the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
08265: historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
08266: distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
08267: thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
08268: peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
08269: in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
08270: peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
08271: valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
08272: of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
08273: such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most
08274: fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
08275: tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
08276: without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some
08277: poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
08278: make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
08279: pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump
08280: for their presumption.
08281: 
08282: But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
08283: celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
08284: famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
08285: but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
08286: of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not
08287: so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so
08288: long did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was
08289: oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand
08290: Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the
08291: vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,
08292: whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white
08293: cross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,
08294: marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In
08295: plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of
08296: Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.
08297: 
08298: But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
08299: times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
08300: finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
08301: by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that
08302: express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
08303: Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture
08304: that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the
08305: Indian King Philip.
08306: 
08307: I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
08308: mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
08309: printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
08310: whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For
08311: this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
08312: as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
08313: the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some
08314: hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
08315: fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
08316: worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
08317: 
08318: First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
08319: perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
08320: conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.
08321: One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters
08322: and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at
08323: home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you
08324: suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by
08325: the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to
08326: the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that
08327: that poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will
08328: read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very
08329: irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what
08330: might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I
08331: tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,
08332: among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which
08333: had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that
08334: had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your
08335: lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of
08336: man’s blood was spilled for it.
08337: 
08338: Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
08339: is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that
08340: when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
08341: enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
08342: facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
08343: being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of
08344: Egypt.
08345: 
08346: But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
08347: testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
08348: Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
08349: malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,
08350: and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale _has_ done it.
08351: 
08352: First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,
08353: was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
08354: boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of
08355: the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
08356: from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
08357: ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that
08358: in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a
08359: surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest
08360: exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being
08361: returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific
08362: in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon
08363: unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly
08364: lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.
08365: At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen
08366: Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;
08367: I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his
08368: son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*
08369: 
08370: *The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed
08371: to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
08372: directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
08373: a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
08374: direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
08375: ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the
08376: shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were
08377: necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
08378: resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just
08379: before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as
08380: if fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the
08381: whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,
08382: and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,
08383: calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which
08384: impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am
08385: correct in my opinion.”
08386: 
08387: Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
08388: black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
08389: hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
08390: fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon
08391: hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
08392: contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the
08393: dismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,
08394: wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”
08395: 
08396: In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “_the mysterious and mortal attack
08397: of the animal_.”
08398: 
08399: Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
08400: totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
08401: particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
08402: though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
08403: allusions to it.
08404: 
08405: Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
08406: commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
08407: dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in
08408: the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,
08409: the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
08410: ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
08411: denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout
08412: sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very
08413: good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set
08414: sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on
08415: the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’
08416: confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the
08417: Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made
08418: straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not
08419: superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with that whale
08420: as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a
08421: similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.
08422: 
08423: I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance
08424: in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you
08425: must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s
08426: famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.
08427: Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
08428: 
08429: “By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day
08430: we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was
08431: very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to
08432: keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was
08433: not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.
08434: An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship
08435: itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived
08436: by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full
08437: sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its
08438: striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,
08439: as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three
08440: feet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell
08441: altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,
08442: concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw
08443: the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain
08444: D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the
08445: vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very
08446: happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
08447: 
08448: Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
08449: question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
08450: adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
08451: Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I
08452: have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.
08453: He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large
08454: one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my
08455: uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
08456: 
08457: In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
08458: too, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
08459: Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just
08460: quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
08461: corroborative example, if such be needed.
08462: 
08463: Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
08464: modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four
08465: o’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
08466: leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which
08467: put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where
08468: they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.
08469: And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for
08470: granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was
08471: a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *
08472: * * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their
08473: carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.
08474: Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his
08475: cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and
08476: seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great
08477: earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief
08478: along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
08479: darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all
08480: caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
08481: 
08482: I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
08483: me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
08484: than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
08485: boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
08486: withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
08487: Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let
08488: me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
08489: running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
08490: secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
08491: horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if
08492: the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
08493: not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
08494: destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
08495: indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will
08496: frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for
08497: several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more
08498: and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,
08499: by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous
08500: event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but
08501: that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;
08502: so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is
08503: nothing new under the sun.
08504: 
08505: In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate
08506: of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and
08507: Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own
08508: times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he
08509: has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating
08510: historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting
08511: the matter presently to be mentioned.
08512: 
08513: Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
08514: of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
08515: in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed
08516: vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
08517: years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
08518: gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species
08519: this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as
08520: well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly
08521: inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long
08522: time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
08523: Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am
08524: certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
08525: present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
08526: resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in
08527: modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
08528: sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on
08529: the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the
08530: skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes
08531: through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
08532: pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
08533: 
08534: In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
08535: substance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
08536: But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
08537: whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
08538: large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
08539: found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements
08540: together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
08541: according to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for
08542: half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
08543: probability have been a sperm whale.
08544: 
08545: 
08546: CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
08547: 
08548: Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
08549: thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
08550: Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
08551: one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and
08552: long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether
08553: to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if
08554: this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
08555: influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even
08556: considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
08557: White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
08558: sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
08559: multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
08560: prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be
08561: indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,
08562: though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling
08563: passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.
08564: 
08565: To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in
08566: the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,
08567: for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
08568: over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
08569: man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
08570: mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in
08571: a sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced
08572: will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;
08573: still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred
08574: his captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself
08575: from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would
08576: elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck
08577: would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
08578: captain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
08579: influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
08580: insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly
08581: manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
08582: that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
08583: strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the
08584: full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
08585: background (for few men’s courage is proof against protracted
08586: meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night
08587: watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of
08588: than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
08589: hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are
08590: more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer
08591: weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any
08592: object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and
08593: passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary
08594: interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily
08595: suspended for the final dash.
08596: 
08597: Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
08598: mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
08599: The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
08600: Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
08601: hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
08602: breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for
08603: the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food
08604: for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and
08605: chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
08606: thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
08607: committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
08608: perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final
08609: and romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have
08610: turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of
08611: all hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some
08612: months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this
08613: same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
08614: soon cashier Ahab.
08615: 
08616: Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
08617: to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
08618: somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
08619: Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
08620: had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
08621: usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
08622: if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
08623: obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From
08624: even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
08625: consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must
08626: of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection
08627: could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
08628: backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
08629: atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be
08630: subjected to.
08631: 
08632: For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
08633: verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
08634: degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s
08635: voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
08636: himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
08637: pursuit of his profession.
08638: 
08639: Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
08640: mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
08641: reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.
08642: 
08643: 
08644: CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
08645: 
08646: It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
08647: about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
08648: Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
08649: for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet
08650: somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
08651: lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
08652: invisible self.
08653: 
08654: I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I
08655: kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
08656: long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
08657: Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
08658: between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
08659: and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess
08660: did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only
08661: broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as
08662: if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically
08663: weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of
08664: the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging
08665: vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise
08666: interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed
08667: necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle
08668: and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
08669: Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
08670: slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
08671: and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
08672: contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s
08673: sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and
08674: woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free
08675: will, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
08676: together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
08677: ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending
08678: to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
08679: and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of
08680: necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
08681: thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
08682: last featuring blow at events.
08683: 
08684: Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
08685: strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
08686: free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds
08687: whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees
08688: was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
08689: forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden
08690: intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that
08691: very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of
08692: whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those
08693: lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
08694: cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.
08695: 
08696: As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
08697: eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
08698: prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries
08699: announcing their coming.
08700: 
08701: “There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
08702: 
08703: “Where-away?”
08704: 
08705: “On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”
08706: 
08707: Instantly all was commotion.
08708: 
08709: The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
08710: reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
08711: other tribes of his genus.
08712: 
08713: “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
08714: disappeared.
08715: 
08716: “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
08717: 
08718: Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
08719: minute to Ahab.
08720: 
08721: The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
08722: before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
08723: leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
08724: our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
08725: when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
08726: concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in
08727: the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
08728: action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by
08729: Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
08730: vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not
08731: appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the
08732: main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the
08733: line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the
08734: mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three
08735: samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager
08736: crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly
08737: poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about
08738: to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.
08739: 
08740: But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
08741: every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
08742: surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
08743: 
08744: 
08745: CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
08746: 
08747: The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
08748: of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
08749: tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always
08750: been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the
08751: captain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The
08752: figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
08753: tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese
08754: jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black
08755: trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness
08756: was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and
08757: coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the
08758: companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion
08759: peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race
08760: notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white
08761: mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents
08762: on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose
08763: to be elsewhere.
08764: 
08765: While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these
08766: strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,
08767: “All ready there, Fedallah?”
08768: 
08769: “Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.
08770: 
08771: “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away
08772: there, I say.”
08773: 
08774: Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
08775: men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with
08776: a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
08777: dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
08778: sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed
08779: boats below.
08780: 
08781: Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth
08782: keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
08783: showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the
08784: stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
08785: widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their
08786: eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of
08787: the other boats obeyed not the command.
08788: 
08789: “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.
08790: 
08791: “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,
08792: Flask, pull out more to leeward!”
08793: 
08794: “Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
08795: great steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew.
08796: “There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay
08797: back!”
08798: 
08799: “Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”
08800: 
08801: “Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.
08802: Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it?
08803: What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”
08804: 
08805: “Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
08806: ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
08807: still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,
08808: my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They
08809: are only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more
08810: the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are
08811: good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a
08812: thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
08813: gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive!
08814: Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap
08815: your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
08816: then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way
08817: there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are
08818: all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,
08819: can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
08820: don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!
08821: Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s
08822: son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.
08823: That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my
08824: steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
08825: marling-spikes!”
08826: 
08827: Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
08828: rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
08829: inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
08830: specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
08831: with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
08832: peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
08833: tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
08834: calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear
08835: such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling
08836: for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy
08837: and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so
08838: broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a
08839: yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon
08840: the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,
08841: whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all
08842: inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.
08843: 
08844: In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
08845: across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
08846: pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
08847: 
08848: “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
08849: please!”
08850: 
08851: “Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
08852: spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
08853: like a flint from Stubb’s.
08854: 
08855: “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
08856: 
08857: “Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
08858: boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad
08859: business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
08860: Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
08861: will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
08862: Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
08863: play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”
08864: 
08865: “Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
08866: diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s
08867: what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
08868: suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom
08869: of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!
08870: It ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
08871: 
08872: Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
08873: as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
08874: awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s
08875: company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got
08876: abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
08877: small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge
08878: of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of
08879: accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
08880: superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room
08881: for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in
08882: the matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the
08883: mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the
08884: dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the
08885: unaccountable Elijah.
08886: 
08887: Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
08888: furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
08889: circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
08890: yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
08891: trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
08892: periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
08893: boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen
08894: pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
08895: displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
08896: gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
08897: horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a
08898: fencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance
08899: any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar
08900: as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All
08901: at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained
08902: fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat
08903: and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in
08904: the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
08905: down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
08906: movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.
08907: 
08908: “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
08909: stand up!”
08910: 
08911: Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
08912: stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
08913: spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
08914: stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
08915: the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
08916: himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently
08917: eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.
08918: 
08919: Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still;
08920: its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
08921: stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
08922: the level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the
08923: whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,
08924: and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the
08925: mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
08926: King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post
08927: was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead
08928: stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.
08929: 
08930: “I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
08931: that.”
08932: 
08933: Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
08934: swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
08935: shoulders for a pedestal.
08936: 
08937: “Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”
08938: 
08939: “That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
08940: fifty feet taller.”
08941: 
08942: Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
08943: boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
08944: Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head
08945: and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous
08946: fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was
08947: Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
08948: breastband to lean against and steady himself by.
08949: 
08950: At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
08951: habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
08952: posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
08953: perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily
08954: perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the
08955: sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more
08956: curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,
08957: unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the
08958: sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired
08959: Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.
08960: Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now
08961: and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby
08962: give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity
08963: stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her
08964: tides and her seasons for that.
08965: 
08966: Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
08967: solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
08968: not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
08969: Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
08970: languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,
08971: where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed
08972: home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his
08973: match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his
08974: harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed
08975: stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,
08976: crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give
08977: way!—there they are!”
08978: 
08979: To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
08980: visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
08981: water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
08982: suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
08983: rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
08984: were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
08985: atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
08986: water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
08987: indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
08988: couriers and detached flying outriders.
08989: 
08990: All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
08991: water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as
08992: a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
08993: hills.
08994: 
08995: “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
08996: intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
08997: from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
08998: visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much
08999: to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the
09000: silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
09001: peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
09002: 
09003: How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something,
09004: my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on
09005: their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you
09006: my Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,
09007: boys. Lay me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring
09008: mad! See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat
09009: from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,
09010: flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
09011: plunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
09012: 
09013: “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
09014: unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
09015: short distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?
09016: yes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,
09017: merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s the word.
09018: Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the devil are you
09019: hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and
09020: keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your
09021: knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I
09022: say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
09023: 
09024: But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
09025: his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
09026: light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious
09027: seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
09028: red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
09029: 
09030: Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
09031: Flask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he
09032: declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its
09033: tail—these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
09034: they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
09035: over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must
09036: put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage
09037: pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
09038: arms, in these critical moments.
09039: 
09040: It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
09041: omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
09042: along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
09043: bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
09044: for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost
09045: seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the
09046: watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the
09047: top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other
09048: side;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and
09049: the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the
09050: ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like
09051: a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all this was thrilling.
09052: 
09053: Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
09054: heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the
09055: first unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel
09056: stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
09057: time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the
09058: hunted sperm whale.
09059: 
09060: The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
09061: more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows
09062: flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted
09063: everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.
09064: The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales
09065: running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still
09066: rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through
09067: the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
09068: escape being torn from the row-locks.
09069: 
09070: Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
09071: ship nor boat to be seen.
09072: 
09073: “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the
09074: sheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall
09075: comes. There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”
09076: 
09077: Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
09078: that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when
09079: with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and
09080: Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
09081: 
09082: Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
09083: so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
09084: of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
09085: instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
09086: fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still
09087: booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
09088: the erected crests of enraged serpents.
09089: 
09090: “That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!” whispered
09091: Starbuck.
09092: 
09093: A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
09094: Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
09095: astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
09096: collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
09097: something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
09098: crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the
09099: white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all
09100: blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
09101: 
09102: Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round
09103: it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
09104: tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,
09105: the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing
09106: eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the
09107: bottom of the ocean.
09108: 
09109: The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
09110: the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white
09111: fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal
09112: in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar
09113: to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
09114: boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
09115: darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
09116: The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were
09117: useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.
09118: So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many
09119: failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then
09120: stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the
09121: standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up
09122: that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,
09123: then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly
09124: holding up hope in the midst of despair.
09125: 
09126: Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
09127: we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over
09128: the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
09129: Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.
09130: We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled
09131: by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were
09132: dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the
09133: sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us
09134: within a distance of not much more than its length.
09135: 
09136: Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
09137: tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a
09138: cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
09139: more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were
09140: dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
09141: landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut
09142: loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship
09143: had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon
09144: some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.
09145: 
09146: 
09147: CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
09148: 
09149: There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
09150: affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
09151: practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more
09152: than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own.
09153: However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He
09154: bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all
09155: hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich
09156: of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for
09157: small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril
09158: of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
09159: good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
09160: and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am
09161: speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;
09162: it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before
09163: might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part
09164: of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to
09165: breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with
09166: it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White
09167: Whale its object.
09168: 
09169: “Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
09170: deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
09171: water; “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often
09172: happen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he
09173: gave me to understand that such things did often happen.
09174: 
09175: “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
09176: oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I
09177: think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
09178: mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
09179: then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
09180: squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”
09181: 
09182: “Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
09183: Cape Horn.”
09184: 
09185: “Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
09186: close by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you
09187: tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,
09188: for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into
09189: death’s jaws?”
09190: 
09191: “Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I
09192: should like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face
09193: foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
09194: that!”
09195: 
09196: Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement
09197: of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
09198: in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
09199: common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
09200: superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign
09201: my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow
09202: who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
09203: scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
09204: the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be
09205: imputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a
09206: squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for
09207: his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to
09208: this uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in
09209: what a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking
09210: all things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
09211: a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be
09212: my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”
09213: 
09214: It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
09215: their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
09216: more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical
09217: life that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded
09218: upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
09219: away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as
09220: good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
09221: supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might
09222: be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
09223: I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
09224: clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.
09225: 
09226: Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
09227: here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
09228: devil fetch the hindmost.
09229: 
09230: 
09231: CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
09232: 
09233: “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg
09234: you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
09235: with my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”
09236: 
09237: “I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.
09238: “If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.
09239: That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other
09240: left, you know.”
09241: 
09242: “I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
09243: 
09244: Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
09245: the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
09246: is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
09247: perils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in
09248: their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried
09249: into the thickest of the fight.
09250: 
09251: But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
09252: with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
09253: considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
09254: extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
09255: comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed
09256: man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the
09257: joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
09258: 
09259: Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
09260: his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
09261: the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
09262: his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually
09263: apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for
09264: Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s
09265: crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
09266: of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s
09267: crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
09268: Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that
09269: matter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little
09270: foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of
09271: port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
09272: whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then
09273: found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his
09274: own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
09275: solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
09276: running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was
09277: observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
09278: coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
09279: withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
09280: he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it
09281: is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing
09282: the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
09283: observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee
09284: fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the
09285: carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a
09286: little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and
09287: curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this
09288: particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to
09289: the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
09290: intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition
09291: did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew
09292: being assigned to that boat.
09293: 
09294: Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
09295: away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
09296: unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
09297: nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
09298: whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
09299: creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
09300: oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that
09301: Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
09302: to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
09303: excitement in the forecastle.
09304: 
09305: But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
09306: phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
09307: somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
09308: muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like
09309: this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
09310: linked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
09311: of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even
09312: authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an
09313: indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as
09314: civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
09315: dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide
09316: among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles
09317: to the east of the continent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
09318: countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
09319: ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory
09320: of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his
09321: descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real
09322: phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
09323: to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
09324: consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the
09325: uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.
09326: 
09327: 
09328: CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
09329: 
09330: Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
09331: swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
09332: the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of
09333: the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
09334: locality, southerly from St. Helena.
09335: 
09336: It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
09337: moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
09338: and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
09339: silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
09340: far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it
09341: looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
09342: the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight
09343: nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a
09344: look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
09345: though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a
09346: hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what
09347: emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at
09348: such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But
09349: when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive
09350: nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,
09351: his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,
09352: every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit
09353: had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she
09354: blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered
09355: more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was
09356: a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
09357: exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
09358: lowering.
09359: 
09360: Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
09361: t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The
09362: best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head
09363: manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,
09364: upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
09365: of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
09366: beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
09367: influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the
09368: other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched
09369: Ahab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
09370: different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively
09371: echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a
09372: coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship
09373: so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager
09374: glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every
09375: sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
09376: 
09377: This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
09378: after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it
09379: was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
09380: disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
09381: night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted
09382: into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;
09383: disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and
09384: somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still
09385: further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever
09386: alluring us on.
09387: 
09388: Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
09389: with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested
09390: the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
09391: whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however
09392: far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by
09393: one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there
09394: reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as
09395: if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the
09396: monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
09397: and most savage seas.
09398: 
09399: These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
09400: wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
09401: which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
09402: devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so
09403: wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
09404: errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.
09405: 
09406: But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
09407: howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
09408: that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
09409: blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
09410: silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
09411: desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
09412: dismal than before.
09413: 
09414: Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
09415: before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
09416: every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
09417: spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
09418: as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a
09419: thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for
09420: their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved
09421: the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great
09422: mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering
09423: it had bred.
09424: 
09425: Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called
09426: of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
09427: attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where
09428: guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed
09429: condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat
09430: that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and
09431: unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still
09432: beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be
09433: descried.
09434: 
09435: During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for
09436: the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
09437: deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
09438: addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything
09439: above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but
09440: passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become
09441: practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its
09442: accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
09443: hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
09444: occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
09445: eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of
09446: the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
09447: stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
09448: guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
09449: sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
09450: belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
09451: painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
09452: madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness
09453: of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence
09454: the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the
09455: blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not
09456: seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old
09457: man’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the
09458: barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his
09459: floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from
09460: which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the
09461: unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of
09462: those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken
09463: of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body
09464: was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were
09465: pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in
09466: the ceiling.*
09467: 
09468: *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
09469: the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself
09470: of the course of the ship.
09471: 
09472: Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
09473: gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.
09474: 
09475: 
09476: CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
09477: 
09478: South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
09479: ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)
09480: by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
09481: fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
09482: in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
09483: 
09484: As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
09485: skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
09486: appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
09487: her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred
09488: over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it
09489: was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They
09490: seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment
09491: that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops
09492: nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and
09493: though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men
09494: in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped
09495: from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those
09496: forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not
09497: one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being
09498: heard from below.
09499: 
09500: “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
09501: 
09502: But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
09503: the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
09504: hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to
09505: make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing
09506: the distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the
09507: Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the
09508: first mere mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for
09509: a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a
09510: boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But
09511: taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,
09512: and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer
09513: and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the
09514: Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters
09515: to the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,
09516: tell them to address them to ——”
09517: 
09518: At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
09519: in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
09520: that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,
09521: darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves
09522: fore and aft with the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his
09523: continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar
09524: sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously
09525: carry meanings.
09526: 
09527: “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
09528: There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of
09529: deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.
09530: But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in
09531: the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
09532: voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the world!”
09533: 
09534: Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
09535: but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
09536: numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
09537: we left behind secure, were all the time before us.
09538: 
09539: Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
09540: ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
09541: than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
09542: in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
09543: tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
09544: before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
09545: either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.
09546: 
09547: 
09548: CHAPTER 53. The Gam.
09549: 
09550: The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
09551: spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this
09552: not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
09553: her—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had
09554: been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer
09555: to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not
09556: to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he
09557: could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But
09558: all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said
09559: here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other
09560: in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.
09561: 
09562: If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
09563: equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
09564: each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
09565: them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment
09566: to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and
09567: resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
09568: illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling
09569: vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone
09570: Fanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural,
09571: I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
09572: interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
09573: sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of
09574: course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
09575: captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
09576: each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
09577: talk about.
09578: 
09579: For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
09580: board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
09581: date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
09582: thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
09583: ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
09584: cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
09585: importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
09586: whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground
09587: itself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of
09588: them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now
09589: far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of
09590: the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,
09591: and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the
09592: sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
09593: congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
09594: privations and perils.
09595: 
09596: Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
09597: that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
09598: with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number
09599: of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when
09600: they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;
09601: for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not
09602: fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English
09603: whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
09604: American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his
09605: nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this
09606: superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be
09607: hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill
09608: more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this
09609: is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the
09610: Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows
09611: that he has a few foibles himself.
09612: 
09613: So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
09614: whalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some
09615: merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
09616: oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
09617: mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies
09618: in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism
09619: upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at
09620: sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and
09621: scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be
09622: much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As
09623: touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,
09624: they run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,
09625: when they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail
09626: is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How many
09627: barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer
09628: apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to
09629: see overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.
09630: 
09631: But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
09632: free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
09633: whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so
09634: utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
09635: even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
09636: and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and
09637: such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and
09638: also all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish
09639: such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it
09640: would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should
09641: like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory
09642: about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at
09643: the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,
09644: he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I
09645: conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,
09646: in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.
09647: 
09648: But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up
09649: and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.
09650: Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not
09651: hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years
09652: been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.
09653: Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the
09654: Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.
09655: 
09656: GAM. NOUN—_A social meeting of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally
09657: on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange
09658: visits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on
09659: board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other._
09660: 
09661: There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
09662: here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
09663: has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
09664: captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
09665: sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often
09666: steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with
09667: gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa
09668: of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if
09669: whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old
09670: aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never
09671: admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete
09672: boat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or
09673: harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the
09674: occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to
09675: his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that
09676: being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him
09677: from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to
09678: the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor
09679: is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting
09680: steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
09681: after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus
09682: completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself
09683: sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
09684: pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
09685: foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a
09686: spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,
09687: it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would
09688: never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
09689: himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his
09690: hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he
09691: generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being
09692: generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.
09693: Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones
09694: too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment
09695: or two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s
09696: hair, and hold on there like grim death.
09697: 
09698: 
09699: CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.
09700: 
09701: (_As told at the Golden Inn._)
09702: 
09703: The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
09704: much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet
09705: more travellers than in any other part.
09706: 
09707: It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
09708: homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned
09709: almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us
09710: strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White
09711: Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s
09712: story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
09713: wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of
09714: God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter
09715: circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may
09716: be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never
09717: reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of
09718: the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the
09719: private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of
09720: whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of
09721: secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and
09722: revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could
09723: not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did
09724: this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full
09725: knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were
09726: they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among
09727: themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast.
09728: Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as
09729: publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now
09730: proceed to put on lasting record.
09731: 
09732: *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
09733: still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
09734: 
09735: For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
09736: narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
09737: saint’s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
09738: Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were
09739: on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they
09740: occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.
09741: 
09742: “Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
09743: rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
09744: was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward
09745: from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the
09746: northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according
09747: to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold
09748: than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But
09749: the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good
09750: luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to
09751: quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,
09752: though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low
09753: down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued
09754: her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy
09755: intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was
09756: the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that
09757: now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the
09758: nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and
09759: repaired.
09760: 
09761: “Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
09762: favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
09763: way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
09764: relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the
09765: ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well
09766: nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous
09767: breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at
09768: her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been
09769: for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the
09770: bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from
09771: Buffalo.
09772: 
09773: “‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’
09774: said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
09775: 
09776: “On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your
09777: courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
09778: gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
09779: large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
09780: Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet
09781: been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
09782: connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,
09783: those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
09784: Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
09785: of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
09786: races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic
09787: isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by
09788: two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long
09789: maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,
09790: dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by
09791: batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they
09792: have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they
09793: yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash
09794: from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by
09795: ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried
09796: lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild
09797: Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give
09798: robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and
09799: Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the
09800: full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,
09801: and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as
09802: direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks
09803: are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full
09804: many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,
09805: though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean
09806: nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,
09807: though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket
09808: beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long
09809: followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
09810: he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods
09811: seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet
09812: was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this
09813: Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by
09814: inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human
09815: recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this
09816: Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he
09817: had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and
09818: Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.
09819: 
09820: “It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
09821: prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again
09822: increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
09823: every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
09824: Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their
09825: whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the
09826: officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the
09827: probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
09828: remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
09829: Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
09830: gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their
09831: pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;
09832: that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other
09833: reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is
09834: in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
09835: latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
09836: 
09837: “Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
09838: gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
09839: several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the
09840: upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
09841: expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a
09842: coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
09843: touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
09844: on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he
09845: betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
09846: seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner
09847: in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was
09848: on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they
09849: stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear
09850: water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the
09851: pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at
09852: the lee scupper-holes.
09853: 
09854: “Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
09855: world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command
09856: over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
09857: superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
09858: conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a
09859: chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make
09860: a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,
09861: gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
09862: head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled
09863: housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a
09864: heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt
09865: Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney,
09866: the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
09867: He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.
09868: 
09869: “Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
09870: rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
09871: his gay banterings.
09872: 
09873: “‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
09874: one of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I
09875: tell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut
09876: away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that
09877: sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of
09878: ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole
09879: posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;
09880: making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him
09881: to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his
09882: estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty
09883: too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in
09884: looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model
09885: of his nose.’
09886: 
09887: “‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,
09888: pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’
09889: 
09890: “‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,
09891: lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;
09892: the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
09893: of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s
09894: utmost energies.
09895: 
09896: “Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
09897: forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
09898: fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his
09899: brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney
09900: to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know
09901: not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate
09902: commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
09903: shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a
09904: pig to run at large.
09905: 
09906: “Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household
09907: work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
09908: evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
09909: foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
09910: sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
09911: would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
09912: vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,
09913: if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the
09914: Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;
09915: and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been
09916: regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should
09917: have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly
09918: nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all
09919: these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair
09920: stood between the two men.
09921: 
09922: “But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
09923: plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat
09924: in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
09925: understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman
09926: fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat
09927: still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s
09928: malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him
09929: and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
09930: instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness
09931: to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a
09932: repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when
09933: aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over
09934: Steelkilt.
09935: 
09936: “Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
09937: exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
09938: the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,
09939: without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the
09940: customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done
09941: little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a
09942: most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
09943: command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an
09944: uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near
09945: by.
09946: 
09947: “Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
09948: all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt
09949: could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still
09950: smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained
09951: doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the
09952: hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
09953: his bidding.
09954: 
09955: “Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
09956: followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
09957: his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had
09958: not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
09959: his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
09960: was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the
09961: windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him
09962: that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
09963: Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
09964: 
09965: “‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
09966: yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
09967: the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
09968: his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
09969: Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
09970: with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his
09971: right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
09972: persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would
09973: murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter
09974: by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant
09975: the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
09976: spouting blood like a whale.
09977: 
09978: “Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
09979: leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
09980: mastheads. They were both Canallers.
09981: 
09982: “‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our
09983: harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
09984: they?’
09985: 
09986: “‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
09987: You must have heard of it.’
09988: 
09989: “‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
09990: land, we know but little of your vigorous North.’
09991: 
09992: “‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere
09993: proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
09994: information may throw side-light upon my story.’
09995: 
09996: “For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
09997: breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and
09998: most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
09999: affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room
10000: and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman
10001: arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or
10002: broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk
10003: counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
10004: stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly
10005: corrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;
10006: there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
10007: under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.
10008: For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
10009: freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so
10010: sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.
10011: 
10012: “‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
10013: crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
10014: 
10015: “‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
10016: Lima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’
10017: 
10018: “‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all
10019: us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by
10020: no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
10021: distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
10022: surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.”
10023: It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
10024: billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,
10025: Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
10026: Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you
10027: pour out again.’
10028: 
10029: “Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would
10030: make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
10031: he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery
10032: Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked
10033: Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,
10034: all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller
10035: so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
10036: grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages
10037: through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not
10038: unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received
10039: good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would
10040: fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming
10041: qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
10042: to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In
10043: sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is
10044: emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
10045: many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of
10046: mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling
10047: captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,
10048: that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its
10049: line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole
10050: transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and
10051: recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.
10052: 
10053: “‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha
10054: upon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I
10055: had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were
10056: cold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’
10057: 
10058: “I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly
10059: had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and
10060: the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down
10061: the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the
10062: uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.
10063: Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted
10064: turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain
10065: danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to
10066: manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the
10067: quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of
10068: the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to
10069: prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his
10070: desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the
10071: forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks
10072: in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves
10073: behind the barricade.
10074: 
10075: “‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them
10076: with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come
10077: out of that, ye cut-throats!’
10078: 
10079: “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
10080: defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
10081: understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal
10082: for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart
10083: lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but
10084: still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
10085: 
10086: “‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their
10087: ringleader.
10088: 
10089: “‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to
10090: sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he
10091: once more raised a pistol.
10092: 
10093: “‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
10094: turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What
10095: say ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their
10096: response.
10097: 
10098: “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
10099: on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our
10100: fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was
10101: boy’s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to
10102: prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his
10103: cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,
10104: men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to
10105: yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to
10106: turn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be
10107: flogged.’
10108: 
10109: “‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’
10110: 
10111: “‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
10112: ‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for
10113: the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
10114: discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s
10115: not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we
10116: won’t be flogged.’
10117: 
10118: “‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.
10119: 
10120: “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you what
10121: it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
10122: rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till
10123: you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’
10124: 
10125: “‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till
10126: ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’
10127: 
10128: “‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
10129: it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down
10130: into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
10131: 
10132: “As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
10133: and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
10134: of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
10135: for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
10136: companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered
10137: something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten
10138: in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
10139: remained neutral.
10140: 
10141: “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
10142: aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at
10143: which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
10144: breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed
10145: in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the
10146: pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary
10147: night dismally resounded through the ship.
10148: 
10149: “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
10150: summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was
10151: then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were
10152: tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,
10153: the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three
10154: days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,
10155: and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;
10156: and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were
10157: ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,
10158: united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained
10159: them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain
10160: reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a
10161: terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he
10162: belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up
10163: into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain
10164: them. Only three were left.
10165: 
10166: “‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
10167: 
10168: “‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.
10169: 
10170: “‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.
10171: 
10172: “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
10173: seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had
10174: last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as
10175: black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to
10176: the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst
10177: out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with
10178: their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a
10179: handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if
10180: by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For
10181: himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.
10182: That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met
10183: with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were
10184: ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a
10185: surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first
10186: man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this
10187: their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;
10188: particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,
10189: in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder
10190: would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play
10191: of these miscreants must come out.
10192: 
10193: “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
10194: separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
10195: of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
10196: the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
10197: thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might
10198: merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead
10199: them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of
10200: villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their
10201: leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in
10202: three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with
10203: cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
10204: 
10205: “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
10206: and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a
10207: few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
10208: struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
10209: allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been
10210: fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along
10211: the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the
10212: mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
10213: morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,
10214: ‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’
10215: 
10216: “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had
10217: rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
10218: former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the
10219: whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the
10220: present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with
10221: a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
10222: 
10223: “‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the
10224: rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing
10225: a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
10226: traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
10227: sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
10228: 
10229: “‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still
10230: rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take
10231: that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’
10232: 
10233: “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
10234: cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
10235: sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I
10236: murder you!’
10237: 
10238: “‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with
10239: the rope to strike.
10240: 
10241: “‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.
10242: 
10243: “‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
10244: 
10245: “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
10246: who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck
10247: rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,
10248: said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’
10249: 
10250: “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
10251: man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever
10252: since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
10253: tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the
10254: whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly
10255: speak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do
10256: what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced
10257: to his pinioned foe.
10258: 
10259: “‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.
10260: 
10261: “‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,
10262: when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing
10263: no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that
10264: might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were
10265: turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
10266: clanged as before.
10267: 
10268: “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
10269: was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
10270: besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
10271: Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
10272: instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no
10273: sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,
10274: that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain
10275: the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
10276: ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the
10277: speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,
10278: not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,
10279: spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still
10280: maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower
10281: for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
10282: cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
10283: berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
10284: vital jaw of the whale.
10285: 
10286: “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
10287: passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
10288: all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
10289: man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney
10290: the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more
10291: than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he
10292: insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the
10293: head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other
10294: circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
10295: 
10296: “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
10297: bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
10298: the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In
10299: this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a
10300: considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
10301: this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
10302: next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning
10303: of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his
10304: leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully
10305: in his watches below.
10306: 
10307: “‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.
10308: 
10309: “‘What do you think? what does it look like?’
10310: 
10311: “‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’
10312: 
10313: “‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length
10314: before him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough
10315: twine,—have you any?’
10316: 
10317: “But there was none in the forecastle.
10318: 
10319: “‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.
10320: 
10321: “‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor.
10322: 
10323: “‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help
10324: himself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him
10325: quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given
10326: him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an
10327: iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the
10328: Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock
10329: for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent
10330: helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready
10331: dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the
10332: fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and
10333: stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
10334: 
10335: “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
10336: deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
10337: avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in
10338: to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
10339: done.
10340: 
10341: “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
10342: day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe
10343: man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There
10344: she rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
10345: 
10346: “‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do
10347: whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’
10348: 
10349: “‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but
10350: that would be too long a story.’
10351: 
10352: “‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
10353: 
10354: “‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more
10355: into the air, Sirs.’
10356: 
10357: “‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks
10358: faint;—fill up his empty glass!’
10359: 
10360: “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so
10361: suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
10362: ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the
10363: moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
10364: his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
10365: plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
10366: ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and
10367: harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to
10368: capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed
10369: askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
10370: that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a
10371: living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality
10372: pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
10373: before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of
10374: the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,
10375: while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or
10376: slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats
10377: were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely
10378: with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a
10379: stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney
10380: sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.
10381: And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.
10382: Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
10383: foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat
10384: struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the
10385: standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,
10386: the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was
10387: tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck
10388: out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that
10389: veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But
10390: the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer
10391: between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,
10392: and went down.
10393: 
10394: “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had
10395: slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
10396: looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,
10397: downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He
10398: cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose
10399: again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the
10400: teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the
10401: whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
10402: 
10403: “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary
10404: place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the
10405: Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
10406: among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
10407: war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
10408: 
10409: “The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
10410: upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
10411: down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over
10412: their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
10413: by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
10414: that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
10415: weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
10416: heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
10417: ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
10418: from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the
10419: Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
10420: him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
10421: before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
10422: reinforcement to his crew.
10423: 
10424: “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
10425: seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from
10426: it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
10427: Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The
10428: captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked
10429: war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the
10430: pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and
10431: foam.
10432: 
10433: “‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.
10434: 
10435: “‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;
10436: ‘no lies.’
10437: 
10438: “‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’
10439: 
10440: “‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he
10441: leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
10442: stood face to face with the captain.
10443: 
10444: “‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
10445: soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
10446: island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike
10447: me!’
10448: 
10449: “‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping
10450: into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
10451: 
10452: “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
10453: roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due
10454: time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck
10455: befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
10456: providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor
10457: headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former
10458: captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
10459: 
10460: “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
10461: and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
10462: Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small
10463: native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
10464: right there, again resumed his cruisings.
10465: 
10466: “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
10467: Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
10468: give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
10469: destroyed him.  * * * *
10470: 
10471: “‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.
10472: 
10473: “‘I am, Don.’
10474: 
10475: “‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
10476: this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing
10477: wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me
10478: if I seem to press.’
10479: 
10480: “‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don
10481: Sebastian’s suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.
10482: 
10483: “‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,
10484: gentlemen?’
10485: 
10486: “‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who
10487: will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised?
10488: this may grow too serious.’
10489: 
10490: “‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’
10491: 
10492: “‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company
10493: to another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
10494: Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’
10495: 
10496: “‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
10497: that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists
10498: you can.’
10499: 
10500: * * * * * *
10501: 
10502: “‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don
10503: Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
10504: 
10505: “‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light,
10506: and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
10507: 
10508: “‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,
10509: gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be
10510: true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I
10511: have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”
10512: 
10513: 
10514: CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
10515: 
10516: I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
10517: something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
10518: eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
10519: alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
10520: It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious
10521: imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
10522: confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the
10523: world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all
10524: wrong.
10525: 
10526: It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
10527: be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For
10528: ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
10529: panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
10530: medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
10531: chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever
10532: since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
10533: only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
10534: presentations of him.
10535: 
10536: Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
10537: to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
10538: Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless
10539: sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,
10540: every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of
10541: them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our
10542: noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The
10543: Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,
10544: depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly
10545: known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and
10546: half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small
10547: section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an
10548: anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.
10549: 
10550: But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
10551: painter’s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
10552: antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing
10553: Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model
10554: of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the
10555: same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.
10556: The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the
10557: surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on
10558: its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are
10559: rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames
10560: by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old
10561: Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old
10562: Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for
10563: the book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a
10564: descending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of
10565: many books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely
10566: fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on
10567: antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless
10568: call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so
10569: intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an
10570: old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
10571: Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
10572: comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
10573: species of the Leviathan.
10574: 
10575: In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
10576: will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
10577: manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
10578: Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the
10579: title-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you
10580: will find some curious whales.
10581: 
10582: But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
10583: pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
10584: by those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some
10585: plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
10586: entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the
10587: Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the
10588: whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among
10589: ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another
10590: plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with
10591: perpendicular flukes.
10592: 
10593: Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
10594: Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round
10595: Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the
10596: Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to
10597: be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from
10598: one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”
10599: I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the
10600: benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say
10601: that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,
10602: to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a
10603: bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not
10604: give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
10605: 
10606: Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the
10607: benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
10608: mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In
10609: the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged
10610: “whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
10611: unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the
10612: narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this
10613: nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
10614: any intelligent public of schoolboys.
10615: 
10616: Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great
10617: naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
10618: several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these
10619: are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland
10620: whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long
10621: experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
10622: counterpart in nature.
10623: 
10624: But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
10625: reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
10626: Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he
10627: gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that
10628: picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
10629: retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is
10630: not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of
10631: a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that
10632: picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
10633: in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that
10634: is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the
10635: pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.
10636: 
10637: As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the
10638: shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
10639: Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
10640: breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of
10641: mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
10642: paint.
10643: 
10644: But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
10645: surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have
10646: been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
10647: drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
10648: the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
10649: Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living
10650: Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The
10651: living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen
10652: at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out
10653: of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element
10654: it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily
10655: into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.
10656: And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour
10657: between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;
10658: yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a
10659: ship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying
10660: shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not
10661: catch.
10662: 
10663: But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
10664: whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at
10665: all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
10666: that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though
10667: Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of
10668: one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed
10669: utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal
10670: characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any
10671: leviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the
10672: mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully
10673: invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so
10674: roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the
10675: head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is
10676: also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which
10677: almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the
10678: thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,
10679: and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy
10680: covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However
10681: recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one
10682: day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”
10683: 
10684: For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
10685: conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world
10686: which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the
10687: mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
10688: considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding
10689: out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in
10690: which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by
10691: going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
10692: being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you
10693: had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this
10694: Leviathan.
10695: 
10696: 
10697: CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True
10698: Pictures of Whaling Scenes.
10699: 
10700: In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
10701: tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
10702: which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
10703: especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
10704: that matter by.
10705: 
10706: I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
10707: Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous
10708: chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far
10709: better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All
10710: Beale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in
10711: the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second
10712: chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no
10713: doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
10714: admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the
10715: Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;
10716: but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.
10717: 
10718: Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
10719: are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
10720: but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,
10721: because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you
10722: can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by
10723: his living hunters.
10724: 
10725: But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
10726: not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
10727: anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and
10728: taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
10729: attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble
10730: Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
10731: the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the
10732: air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of
10733: the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the
10734: monster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
10735: incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
10736: incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
10737: from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
10738: true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
10739: poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
10740: swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
10741: of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing
10742: down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical
10743: details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I
10744: could not draw so good a one.
10745: 
10746: In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
10747: the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his
10748: black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
10749: Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
10750: that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
10751: must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are
10752: pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
10753: maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
10754: back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through
10755: the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and
10756: causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh
10757: the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all
10758: raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the
10759: glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the
10760: powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
10761: fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
10762: inserted into his spout-hole.
10763: 
10764: Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
10765: was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
10766: marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the
10767: lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,
10768: and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing
10769: commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the
10770: beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great
10771: battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern
10772: Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a
10773: charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that
10774: gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.
10775: 
10776: The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
10777: things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
10778: they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
10779: experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
10780: Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
10781: finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the
10782: whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale
10783: draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical
10784: outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so
10785: far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to
10786: sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned
10787: Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland
10788: whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and
10789: porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,
10790: chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a
10791: Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six
10792: fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement
10793: to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so
10794: important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured
10795: for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of
10796: the Peace.
10797: 
10798: In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
10799: French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
10800: “H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
10801: purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet
10802: noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,
10803: inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened
10804: sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,
10805: both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,
10806: when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen
10807: under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving
10808: is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in
10809: the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;
10810: the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to
10811: a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,
10812: is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and
10813: lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in
10814: its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
10815: half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the
10816: smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
10817: over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
10818: with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the
10819: excited seamen.
10820: 
10821: 
10822: CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in
10823: Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.
10824: 
10825: On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
10826: crippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted
10827: board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
10828: leg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
10829: (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is
10830: being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten
10831: years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited
10832: that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification
10833: has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever
10834: published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a
10835: stump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for
10836: ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman
10837: make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
10838: amputation.
10839: 
10840: Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
10841: Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
10842: whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm
10843: Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and
10844: other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous
10845: little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough
10846: material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little
10847: boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
10848: skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their
10849: jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,
10850: they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s
10851: fancy.
10852: 
10853: Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
10854: to that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called
10855: savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I
10856: myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
10857: Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.
10858: 
10859: Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
10860: hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian
10861: war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
10862: carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.
10863: For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that
10864: miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
10865: cost steady years of steady application.
10866: 
10867: As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
10868: same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of
10869: his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not
10870: quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as
10871: the Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
10872: suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert
10873: Durer.
10874: 
10875: Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
10876: the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
10877: forecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with much
10878: accuracy.
10879: 
10880: At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
10881: by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is
10882: sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales
10883: are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some
10884: old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
10885: weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
10886: intents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine
10887: them closely enough to decide upon their merit.
10888: 
10889: In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
10890: cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
10891: you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
10892: Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against
10893: them in a surf of green surges.
10894: 
10895: Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
10896: continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
10897: some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
10898: profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be
10899: a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you
10900: wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the
10901: exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,
10902: else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your
10903: precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;
10904: like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once
10905: high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.
10906: 
10907: Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
10908: great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as
10909: when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies
10910: locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased
10911: Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright
10912: points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent
10913: Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase
10914: against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and
10915: the Flying Fish.
10916: 
10917: With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
10918: spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to
10919: see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really
10920: lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!
10921: 
10922: 
10923: CHAPTER 58. Brit.
10924: 
10925: Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
10926: of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
10927: largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that
10928: we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden
10929: wheat.
10930: 
10931: On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
10932: the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
10933: swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
10934: wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
10935: from the water that escaped at the lip.
10936: 
10937: As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
10938: scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
10939: monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving
10940: behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
10941: 
10942: *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does
10943: not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
10944: being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
10945: meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
10946: floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
10947: 
10948: But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
10949: all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when
10950: they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms
10951: looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in
10952: the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will
10953: sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
10954: to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;
10955: even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species
10956: of the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their
10957: immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such
10958: bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with
10959: the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.
10960: 
10961: Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
10962: deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though
10963: some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
10964: of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the
10965: thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for
10966: example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
10967: the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any
10968: generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
10969: 
10970: But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
10971: have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
10972: repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
10973: so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
10974: one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of
10975: all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
10976: tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;
10977: though but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man
10978: may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
10979: future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,
10980: to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize
10981: the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
10982: continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
10983: of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.
10984: 
10985: The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
10986: vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
10987: That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
10988: of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;
10989: two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
10990: 
10991: Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
10992: miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
10993: when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
10994: swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
10995: precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
10996: 
10997: But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
10998: is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
10999: murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
11000: spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
11001: own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the
11002: rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of
11003: ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting
11004: like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean
11005: overruns the globe.
11006: 
11007: Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
11008: glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
11009: hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
11010: brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
11011: dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once
11012: more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey
11013: upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
11014: 
11015: Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
11016: earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
11017: strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
11018: surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one
11019: insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the
11020: horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that
11021: isle, thou canst never return!
11022: 
11023: 
11024: CHAPTER 59. Squid.
11025: 
11026: Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
11027: way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling
11028: her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
11029: masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a
11030: plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
11031: alluring jet would be seen.
11032: 
11033: But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
11034: spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
11035: the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
11036: across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered
11037: together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible
11038: sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
11039: 
11040: In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
11041: higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
11042: our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening
11043: for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,
11044: and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
11045: thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
11046: more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,
11047: the negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right
11048: ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”
11049: 
11050: Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
11051: bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on
11052: the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
11053: his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
11054: indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
11055: 
11056: Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
11057: gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
11058: ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
11059: whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
11060: him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
11061: perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
11062: orders for lowering.
11063: 
11064: The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all
11065: swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with
11066: oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot
11067: where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the
11068: moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
11069: phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A
11070: vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
11071: cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms
11072: radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of
11073: anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
11074: No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of
11075: either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an
11076: unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
11077: 
11078: As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
11079: gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
11080: exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to
11081: have seen thee, thou white ghost!”
11082: 
11083: “What was it, Sir?” said Flask.
11084: 
11085: “The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
11086: and returned to their ports to tell of it.”
11087: 
11088: But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;
11089: the rest as silently following.
11090: 
11091: Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
11092: with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
11093: being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
11094: portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
11095: declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
11096: of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature
11097: and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm
11098: whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food
11099: above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the
11100: spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the
11101: surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,
11102: precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will
11103: disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some
11104: of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They
11105: fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings
11106: by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other
11107: species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.
11108: 
11109: There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
11110: Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
11111: which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
11112: some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But
11113: much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
11114: assigns it.
11115: 
11116: By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
11117: creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
11118: cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
11119: seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.
11120: 
11121: 
11122: CHAPTER 60. The Line.
11123: 
11124: With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
11125: for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
11126: I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
11127: 
11128: The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
11129: vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
11130: ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable
11131: to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to
11132: the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary
11133: quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which
11134: it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in
11135: general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however
11136: much it may give it compactness and gloss.
11137: 
11138: Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
11139: entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
11140: so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and
11141: I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more
11142: handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
11143: fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian
11144: to behold.
11145: 
11146: The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first
11147: sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment
11148: its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
11149: twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
11150: to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures
11151: something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is
11152: spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
11153: though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely
11154: bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any
11155: hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of
11156: the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in
11157: running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,
11158: the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some
11159: harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,
11160: carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
11161: block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all
11162: possible wrinkles and twists.
11163: 
11164: In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
11165: being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in
11166: this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into
11167: the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,
11168: nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
11169: rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in
11170: thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which
11171: will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
11172: concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the
11173: American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
11174: prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
11175: 
11176: Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
11177: eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
11178: tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
11179: This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:
11180: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
11181: neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to
11182: threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
11183: harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug
11184: of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first
11185: boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
11186: arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the
11187: lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
11188: whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
11189: minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
11190: boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
11191: the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.
11192: 
11193: Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
11194: taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
11195: again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise
11196: upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his
11197: wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately
11198: sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the
11199: extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size
11200: of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it
11201: hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the
11202: boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being
11203: coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale
11204: still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the
11205: rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
11206: that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too
11207: tedious to detail.
11208: 
11209: Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
11210: twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the
11211: oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid
11212: eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest
11213: snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
11214: woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
11215: and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
11216: unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
11217: contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
11218: circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
11219: to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what
11220: cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,
11221: and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
11222: will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus
11223: hung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before
11224: King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of
11225: death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.
11226: 
11227: Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
11228: repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
11229: this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
11230: For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is
11231: like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a
11232: steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
11233: wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in
11234: the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,
11235: and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest
11236: warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
11237: simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
11238: Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
11239: never pierce you out.
11240: 
11241: Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
11242: prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
11243: for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
11244: contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
11245: powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the
11246: line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
11247: into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
11248: any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
11249: live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their
11250: necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
11251: that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
11252: And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would
11253: not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
11254: your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.
11255: 
11256: 
11257: CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.
11258: 
11259: If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
11260: Queequeg it was quite a different object.
11261: 
11262: “When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
11263: bow of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”
11264: 
11265: The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
11266: to engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of
11267: sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean
11268: through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively
11269: ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,
11270: flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than
11271: those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
11272: 
11273: It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
11274: leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
11275: in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in
11276: that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of
11277: my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,
11278: long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
11279: 
11280: Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
11281: seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that
11282: at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every
11283: swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering
11284: helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the
11285: wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
11286: 
11287: Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
11288: hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved
11289: me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not
11290: forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like
11291: the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian
11292: hue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating
11293: in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
11294: vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of
11295: a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck
11296: by some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all
11297: at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
11298: all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from
11299: aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
11300: regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.
11301: 
11302: “Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
11303: dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
11304: 
11305: The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
11306: ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
11307: leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples
11308: as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,
11309: Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
11310: but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the
11311: boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
11312: the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
11313: the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
11314: and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
11315: 
11316: “There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
11317: Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite
11318: was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
11319: whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and
11320: much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the
11321: honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length
11322: become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore
11323: no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
11324: And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the
11325: assault.
11326: 
11327: Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,
11328: he was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
11329: yeast which he brewed.*
11330: 
11331: *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
11332: entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
11333: apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
11334: him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does
11335: so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the
11336: upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water
11337: formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he
11338: thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
11339: galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
11340: 
11341: “Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of
11342: time—but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried
11343: Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em
11344: the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start
11345: her, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy,
11346: easy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
11347: buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start
11348: her!”
11349: 
11350: “Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
11351: war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
11352: involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
11353: which the eager Indian gave.
11354: 
11355: But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!
11356: Kee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
11357: like a pacing tiger in his cage.
11358: 
11359: “Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
11360: mouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels
11361: cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still
11362: encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from
11363: his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the
11364: welcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon
11365: was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment
11366: something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was
11367: the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two
11368: additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
11369: increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and
11370: mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round
11371: and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
11372: blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from
11373: which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
11374: these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s
11375: sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time
11376: striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
11377: 
11378: “Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him
11379: seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
11380: it.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
11381: The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
11382: Stubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering
11383: business truly in that rocking commotion.
11384: 
11385: *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
11386: stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
11387: running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
11388: bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most
11389: convenient.
11390: 
11391: From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
11392: of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
11393: would have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the
11394: other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at
11395: once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
11396: in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
11397: little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
11398: gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
11399: clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
11400: form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order
11401: to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics
11402: seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale
11403: somewhat slackened his flight.
11404: 
11405: “Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
11406: towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
11407: yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,
11408: firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart
11409: into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately
11410: sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then
11411: ranging up for another fling.
11412: 
11413: The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down
11414: a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which
11415: bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun
11416: playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection
11417: into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.
11418: And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot
11419: from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the
11420: mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his
11421: crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again
11422: and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and
11423: again sent it into the whale.
11424: 
11425: “Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
11426: relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along
11427: the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned
11428: his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
11429: churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
11430: watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
11431: breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was
11432: the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting
11433: from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the
11434: monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in
11435: impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,
11436: instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from
11437: that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.
11438: 
11439: And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
11440: view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting
11441: his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,
11442: gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees
11443: of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran
11444: dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
11445: 
11446: “He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.
11447: 
11448: “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
11449: Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
11450: thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
11451: 
11452: 
11453: CHAPTER 62. The Dart.
11454: 
11455: A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
11456: 
11457: According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
11458: off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
11459: steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
11460: oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,
11461: nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what
11462: is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the
11463: distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting
11464: the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the
11465: uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman
11466: activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
11467: loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the
11468: top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half
11469: started—what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I
11470: cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same
11471: time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the
11472: fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting
11473: cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his
11474: oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the
11475: crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
11476: somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen
11477: in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are
11478: successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed
11479: and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
11480: blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
11481: absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
11482: owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that
11483: makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
11484: you expect to find it there when most wanted!
11485: 
11486: Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
11487: that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
11488: likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
11489: themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the
11490: headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
11491: station in the bows of the boat.
11492: 
11493: Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
11494: foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from
11495: first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
11496: rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
11497: obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a
11498: slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
11499: whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
11500: majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
11501: much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
11502: harpooneer that has caused them.
11503: 
11504: To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
11505: world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out
11506: of toil.
11507: 
11508: 
11509: CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.
11510: 
11511: Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
11512: productive subjects, grow the chapters.
11513: 
11514: The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
11515: It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,
11516: which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the
11517: bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of
11518: the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the
11519: prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who
11520: snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his
11521: rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in
11522: the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.
11523: 
11524: But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
11525: the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
11526: instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
11527: coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It
11528: is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to
11529: the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon
11530: receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,
11531: however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into
11532: him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the
11533: line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,
11534: be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else
11535: the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the
11536: water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line
11537: (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,
11538: prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended
11539: with the saddest and most fatal casualties.
11540: 
11541: Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
11542: overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
11543: skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
11544: or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
11545: Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
11546: fairly captured and a corpse.
11547: 
11548: Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
11549: one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
11550: qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
11551: such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
11552: simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is
11553: supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first
11554: one be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
11555: faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
11556: most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
11557: painted.
11558: 
11559: 
11560: CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.
11561: 
11562: Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a
11563: calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
11564: business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen
11565: men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
11566: fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse
11567: in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long
11568: intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of
11569: the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever
11570: they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will
11571: draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this
11572: grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead
11573: in bulk.
11574: 
11575: Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s
11576: main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
11577: dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly
11578: eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
11579: securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
11580: went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
11581: morning.
11582: 
11583: Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
11584: evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
11585: creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
11586: despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
11587: reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand
11588: other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
11589: advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought
11590: from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to
11591: cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the
11592: deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking
11593: links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by
11594: the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies
11595: with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness
11596: of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship
11597: and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one
11598: reclines while the other remains standing.*
11599: 
11600: *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
11601: reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
11602: is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
11603: relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
11604: flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
11605: so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
11606: put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
11607: small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
11608: and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.
11609: By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
11610: of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
11611: made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last
11612: locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of
11613: junction with its broad flukes or lobes.
11614: 
11615: If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
11616: on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an
11617: unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
11618: he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
11619: to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping
11620: cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely
11621: manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of
11622: the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.
11623: 
11624: “A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
11625: me one from his small!”
11626: 
11627: Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
11628: thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
11629: the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds
11630: of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers
11631: who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale
11632: designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
11633: 
11634: About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
11635: lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
11636: at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb
11637: the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their
11638: mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,
11639: swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.
11640: The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp
11641: slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the
11642: sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as
11643: before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and
11644: turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of
11645: the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the
11646: shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable
11647: surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains
11648: a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave
11649: on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in
11650: countersinking for a screw.
11651: 
11652: Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
11653: will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs
11654: round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
11655: killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant
11656: butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s
11657: live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,
11658: also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away
11659: under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the
11660: whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,
11661: that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;
11662: and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
11663: crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy
11664: in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be
11665: decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be
11666: set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do
11667: most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no
11668: conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
11669: numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm
11670: whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen
11671: that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
11672: devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.
11673: 
11674: But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
11675: going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
11676: his own epicurean lips.
11677: 
11678: “Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his
11679: legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
11680: and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
11681: with his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”
11682: 
11683: The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
11684: roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
11685: shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
11686: something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
11687: scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came
11688: shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,
11689: after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old
11690: Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came
11691: to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with
11692: both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he
11693: bowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways
11694: inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.
11695: 
11696: “Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
11697: mouth, “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been
11698: beating this steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say
11699: that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks
11700: now over the side, don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a
11701: shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are
11702: welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must
11703: keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and
11704: deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his
11705: sideboard; “now then, go and preach to ’em!”
11706: 
11707: Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck
11708: to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over
11709: the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other
11710: hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in
11711: a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly
11712: crawling behind, overheard all that was said.
11713: 
11714: “Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
11715: noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say
11716: dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you
11717: must stop dat dam racket!”
11718: 
11719: “Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap
11720: on the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way
11721: when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”
11722: 
11723: “Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.
11724: 
11725: “No, cook; go on, go on.”
11726: 
11727: “Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—
11728: 
11729: “Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and
11730: Fleece continued.
11731: 
11732: “Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
11733: fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de
11734: tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and
11735: bitin’ dare?”
11736: 
11737: “Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk
11738: to ’em gentlemanly.”
11739: 
11740: Once more the sermon proceeded.
11741: 
11742: “Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat
11743: is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
11744: de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why
11745: den you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well
11746: goberned. Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a
11747: helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your
11748: neighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
11749: whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale
11750: belong to some one else. I know some o’ you has berry brig mout,
11751: brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small
11752: bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to
11753: bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de
11754: scrouge to help demselves.”
11755: 
11756: “Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”
11757: 
11758: “No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’
11759: each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to
11760: such dam g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare
11761: bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you
11762: den; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and
11763: can’t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.”
11764: 
11765: “Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
11766: Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”
11767: 
11768: Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
11769: shrill voice, and cried—
11770: 
11771: “Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
11772: your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”
11773: 
11774: “Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand
11775: just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
11776: attention.”
11777: 
11778: “All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
11779: desired position.
11780: 
11781: “Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go
11782: back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you,
11783: cook?”
11784: 
11785: “What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.
11786: 
11787: “Silence! How old are you, cook?”
11788: 
11789: “’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.
11790: 
11791: “And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
11792: and don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
11793: mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
11794: question. “Where were you born, cook?”
11795: 
11796: “’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”
11797: 
11798: “Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what
11799: country you were born in, cook!”
11800: 
11801: “Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.
11802: 
11803: “No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You
11804: must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a
11805: whale-steak yet.”
11806: 
11807: “Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning
11808: round to depart.
11809: 
11810: “Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak
11811: there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take
11812: it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”
11813: 
11814: Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
11815: muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”
11816: 
11817: “Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the
11818: church?”
11819: 
11820: “Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.
11821: 
11822: “And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
11823: where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
11824: his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,
11825: and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb.
11826: “Where do you expect to go to, cook?”
11827: 
11828: “Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
11829: 
11830: “Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question.
11831: Now what’s your answer?”
11832: 
11833: “When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his
11834: whole air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed
11835: angel will come and fetch him.”
11836: 
11837: “Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch
11838: him where?”
11839: 
11840: “Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
11841: keeping it there very solemnly.
11842: 
11843: “So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
11844: you are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it
11845: gets? Main-top, eh?”
11846: 
11847: “Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.
11848: 
11849: “You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where
11850: your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
11851: crawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t
11852: get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a
11853: ticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us
11854: are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye
11855: hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart,
11856: when I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s
11857: your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it there
11858: now, and pay attention.”
11859: 
11860: “All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
11861: vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at
11862: one and the same time.
11863: 
11864: “Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
11865: that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
11866: don’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for
11867: my private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not
11868: to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live
11869: coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now
11870: to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by
11871: to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends
11872: of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”
11873: 
11874: But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
11875: 
11876: “Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
11877: D’ye hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
11878: go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”
11879: 
11880: “Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if
11881: he ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,
11882: limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.
11883: 
11884: 
11885: CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.
11886: 
11887: That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
11888: like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
11889: outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
11890: philosophy of it.
11891: 
11892: It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
11893: Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
11894: prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the
11895: court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
11896: eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
11897: whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The
11898: meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being
11899: well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.
11900: The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great
11901: porpoise grant from the crown.
11902: 
11903: The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
11904: hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
11905: when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
11906: long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men
11907: like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
11908: not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
11909: old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous
11910: doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
11911: juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who
11912: long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that
11913: these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
11914: whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among
11915: the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,
11916: they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
11917: like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
11918: They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can
11919: hardly keep his hands off.
11920: 
11921: But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
11922: exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
11923: delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
11924: buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
11925: pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
11926: is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
11927: third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
11928: butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
11929: some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches
11930: of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
11931: ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many
11932: a good supper have I thus made.
11933: 
11934: In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
11935: dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two
11936: plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large
11937: puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most
11938: delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is
11939: quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young
11940: bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves’ brains, by
11941: and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to
11942: tell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires
11943: uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with
11944: an intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the
11945: saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at
11946: him, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.
11947: 
11948: It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
11949: unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
11950: abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration
11951: before mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing
11952: of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man
11953: that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was
11954: hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would
11955: have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the
11956: meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds
11957: staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight
11958: take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a
11959: cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that
11960: salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
11961: will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
11962: judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who
11963: nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
11964: paté-de-foie-gras.
11965: 
11966: But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
11967: adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my
11968: civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is
11969: that handle made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
11970: you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
11971: that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill
11972: did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to
11973: Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month
11974: or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but
11975: steel pens.
11976: 
11977: 
11978: CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
11979: 
11980: When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
11981: weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
11982: thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
11983: him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very
11984: soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the
11985: common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send
11986: every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation
11987: that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and
11988: two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck
11989: to see that all goes well.
11990: 
11991: But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will
11992: not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
11993: round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
11994: stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In
11995: most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
11996: largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
11997: diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a
11998: procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
11999: tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the
12000: present case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man
12001: unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
12002: would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
12003: those sharks the maggots in it.
12004: 
12005: Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
12006: concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came
12007: on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for
12008: immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering
12009: three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
12010: sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an
12011: incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep
12012: into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy
12013: confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
12014: always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
12015: incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at
12016: each other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and
12017: bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again
12018: by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was
12019: this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
12020: creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
12021: their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
12022: life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
12023: one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried
12024: to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.
12025: 
12026: *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
12027: is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
12028: corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
12029: sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
12030: the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when
12031: being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a
12032: stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.
12033: 
12034: “Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,
12035: agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or
12036: Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”
12037: 
12038: 
12039: CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.
12040: 
12041: It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
12042: professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
12043: turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would
12044: have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
12045: 
12046: In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
12047: things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and
12048: which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was
12049: swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the
12050: strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the
12051: hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted
12052: to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over
12053: the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one
12054: hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the
12055: side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,
12056: began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just
12057: above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,
12058: semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the
12059: main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving
12060: in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship
12061: careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads
12062: of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her
12063: frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the
12064: whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
12065: helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap
12066: is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from
12067: the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it
12068: the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as
12069: the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,
12070: so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
12071: stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the
12072: windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the
12073: water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the
12074: line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck
12075: and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and
12076: indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher
12077: and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the
12078: windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious
12079: blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and
12080: every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else
12081: it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.
12082: 
12083: One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
12084: called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
12085: out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into
12086: this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
12087: hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
12088: what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
12089: to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
12090: few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
12091: twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper
12092: strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for
12093: lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one
12094: tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other
12095: is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the
12096: main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
12097: blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
12098: coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of
12099: plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting
12100: and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the
12101: heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates
12102: scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by
12103: way of assuaging the general friction.
12104: 
12105: 
12106: CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.
12107: 
12108: I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
12109: of the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced
12110: whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion
12111: remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
12112: 
12113: The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you
12114: know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence
12115: of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
12116: ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
12117: 
12118: Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
12119: creature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet
12120: in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;
12121: because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the
12122: whale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer
12123: of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
12124: True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with
12125: your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat
12126: resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as
12127: flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it
12128: not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I
12129: have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.
12130: It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed
12131: page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a
12132: magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales
12133: through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at
12134: here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I
12135: admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be
12136: regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to
12137: speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
12138: the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
12139: new-born child. But no more of this.
12140: 
12141: Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
12142: as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
12143: hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,
12144: or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three
12145: fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence
12146: be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose
12147: mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten
12148: barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three
12149: quarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.
12150: 
12151: In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
12152: the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over
12153: obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
12154: thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line
12155: engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
12156: isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as
12157: if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some
12158: instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a
12159: veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.
12160: These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers
12161: on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to
12162: use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the
12163: hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck
12164: with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the
12165: famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.
12166: Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains
12167: undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another
12168: thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm
12169: Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially
12170: his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by
12171: reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random
12172: aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,
12173: which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact
12174: with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a
12175: little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me
12176: that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact
12177: with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
12178: full-grown bulls of the species.
12179: 
12180: A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
12181: whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
12182: pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very
12183: happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
12184: as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho
12185: slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of
12186: this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
12187: himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.
12188: What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy
12189: seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other
12190: fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but
12191: these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very
12192: bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the
12193: lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn
12194: fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his
12195: blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after
12196: explanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as
12197: indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at
12198: home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when
12199: seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,
12200: perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is
12201: found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been
12202: proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than
12203: that of a Borneo negro in summer.
12204: 
12205: It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
12206: individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
12207: virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself
12208: after the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,
12209: live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep
12210: thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and
12211: like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
12212: thine own.
12213: 
12214: But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
12215: how few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the
12216: whale!
12217: 
12218: 
12219: CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.
12220: 
12221: “Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”
12222: 
12223: The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
12224: beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
12225: it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.
12226: Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and
12227: splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with
12228: rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many
12229: insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats
12230: further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,
12231: what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the
12232: murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that
12233: hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon
12234: the fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that
12235: great mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite
12236: perspectives.
12237: 
12238: There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all
12239: in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
12240: speckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween,
12241: if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral
12242: they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from
12243: which not the mightiest whale is free.
12244: 
12245: Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
12246: survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war
12247: or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring
12248: the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
12249: the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the
12250: whale’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
12251: log—_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years
12252: afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly
12253: sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there
12254: when a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your
12255: utility of traditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of
12256: old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in
12257: the air! There’s orthodoxy!
12258: 
12259: Thus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror
12260: to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
12261: world.
12262: 
12263: Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than
12264: the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe
12265: in them.
12266: 
12267: 
12268: CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.
12269: 
12270: It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
12271: the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the
12272: Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
12273: whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
12274: 
12275: Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
12276: on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
12277: very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the
12278: surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
12279: between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
12280: discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear
12281: in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut
12282: many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without
12283: so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
12284: made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,
12285: and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
12286: into the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he
12287: demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?
12288: 
12289: When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
12290: cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small
12291: whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a
12292: full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head
12293: embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend
12294: such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this
12295: were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’
12296: scales.
12297: 
12298: The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
12299: was hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so
12300: that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
12301: there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of
12302: the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
12303: on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
12304: blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant
12305: Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.
12306: 
12307: When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
12308: below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
12309: now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
12310: lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves
12311: upon the sea.
12312: 
12313: A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
12314: from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
12315: gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
12316: Stubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the whale’s
12317: decapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
12318: mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood
12319: leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
12320: 
12321: It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
12322: intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast
12323: and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a
12324: beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty
12325: head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou
12326: hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,
12327: has moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and
12328: navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous
12329: hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the
12330: drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar
12331: home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many
12332: a sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay
12333: them down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their
12334: flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true
12335: to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st the
12336: murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours
12337: he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his
12338: murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the
12339: neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to
12340: outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the
12341: planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”
12342: 
12343: “Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
12344: 
12345: “Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
12346: himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That
12347: lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
12348: man.—Where away?”
12349: 
12350: “Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
12351: to us!
12352: 
12353: “Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,
12354: and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!
12355: how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the
12356: smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate
12357: in mind.”
12358: 
12359: 
12360: CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.
12361: 
12362: Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than
12363: the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
12364: 
12365: By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads
12366: proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and
12367: shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the
12368: Pequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what
12369: response would be made.
12370: 
12371: Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
12372: of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which
12373: signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
12374: vessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale
12375: commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
12376: considerable distances and with no small facility.
12377: 
12378: The Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting
12379: her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.
12380: Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee,
12381: and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was
12382: being rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain,
12383: the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token
12384: of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the
12385: Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her
12386: captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though
12387: himself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was
12388: half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and
12389: flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine
12390: of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with
12391: the Pequod.
12392: 
12393: But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
12394: interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s
12395: boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to
12396: the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it
12397: blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times
12398: by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed
12399: some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper
12400: bearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now
12401: and then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at
12402: intervals not without still another interruption of a very different
12403: sort.
12404: 
12405: Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular
12406: appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
12407: notabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish
12408: man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
12409: yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut
12410: tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on
12411: his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
12412: 
12413: So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
12414: exclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the
12415: Town-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story
12416: told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
12417: previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account
12418: and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
12419: question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
12420: Jeroboam. His story was this:
12421: 
12422: He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
12423: Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
12424: meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
12425: trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
12426: carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
12427: gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,
12428: apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,
12429: where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,
12430: common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate
12431: for the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway
12432: upon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in
12433: a freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
12434: the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he
12435: set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
12436: vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which
12437: he declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,
12438: excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real
12439: delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of
12440: the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they
12441: were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical
12442: use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
12443: pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
12444: apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first
12445: convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and
12446: vials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in
12447: case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his
12448: disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the
12449: captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of
12450: them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor
12451: would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he
12452: would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of
12453: the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared
12454: little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had
12455: broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the
12456: plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be
12457: stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor
12458: devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to
12459: his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
12460: Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.
12461: Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the
12462: measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
12463: power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
12464: return to the Pequod.
12465: 
12466: “I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
12467: Mayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”
12468: 
12469: But now Gabriel started to his feet.
12470: 
12471: “Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
12472: plague!”
12473: 
12474: “Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that
12475: instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
12476: drowned all speech.
12477: 
12478: “Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
12479: back.
12480: 
12481: “Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the
12482: horrible tail!”
12483: 
12484: “I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if
12485: dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
12486: succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
12487: caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the
12488: hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was
12489: seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel
12490: nature seemed to warrant.
12491: 
12492: When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
12493: concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from
12494: Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed
12495: leagued with him.
12496: 
12497: It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
12498: a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of
12499: Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this
12500: intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the
12501: White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering
12502: insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the
12503: Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some
12504: year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the
12505: mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;
12506: and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
12507: opportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and
12508: forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
12509: With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
12510: perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron
12511: fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was
12512: tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of
12513: speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while
12514: Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the
12515: reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the
12516: whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a
12517: broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,
12518: temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next
12519: instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily
12520: into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea
12521: at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was
12522: harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.
12523: 
12524: It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
12525: Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
12526: Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
12527: oftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
12528: headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But
12529: strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
12530: when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
12531: discernible; the man being stark dead.
12532: 
12533: The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly
12534: descried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”
12535: Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
12536: the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added
12537: influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
12538: specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
12539: prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one
12540: of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror
12541: to the ship.
12542: 
12543: Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
12544: that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
12545: intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which
12546: Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to
12547: his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
12548: downward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down
12549: there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”
12550: 
12551: Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just
12552: bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
12553: officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”
12554: 
12555: Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
12556: ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
12557: depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
12558: Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received
12559: after attaining an age of two or three years or more.
12560: 
12561: Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely
12562: tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
12563: consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a
12564: letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.
12565: 
12566: “Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but
12567: a dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
12568: long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
12569: insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
12570: its coming any closer to the ship.
12571: 
12572: Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
12573: woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,
12574: Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”
12575: 
12576: “Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let
12577: me have it.”
12578: 
12579: “Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going
12580: that way.”
12581: 
12582: “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
12583: receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he
12584: caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
12585: boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;
12586: the boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by
12587: magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He
12588: clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the
12589: letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s
12590: feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their
12591: oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the
12592: Pequod.
12593: 
12594: As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
12595: of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
12596: affair.
12597: 
12598: 
12599: CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
12600: 
12601: In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
12602: there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands
12603: are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no
12604: staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has
12605: to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the
12606: description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was
12607: mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the
12608: blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the
12609: spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
12610: same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my
12611: particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to
12612: descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.
12613: But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall
12614: remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is
12615: concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,
12616: excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten
12617: feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,
12618: half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like
12619: a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured
12620: in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at
12621: least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better
12622: chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
12623: 
12624: Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar
12625: in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to
12626: attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead
12627: whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
12628: a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg
12629: down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a
12630: monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
12631: waist.
12632: 
12633: It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
12634: proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
12635: ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
12636: leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,
12637: were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both
12638: usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should
12639: drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature
12640: united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I
12641: any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond
12642: entailed.
12643: 
12644: So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
12645: that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
12646: perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
12647: company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that
12648: another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
12649: disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of
12650: interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have
12651: so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked
12652: him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten
12653: to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of
12654: mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in
12655: most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a
12656: plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your
12657: apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,
12658: you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these
12659: and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s
12660: monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I
12661: came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do
12662: what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
12663: 
12664: *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
12665: that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This
12666: improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
12667: than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
12668: possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
12669: monkey-rope holder.
12670: 
12671: I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
12672: whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
12673: rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy
12674: he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
12675: night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before
12676: pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures
12677: swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
12678: 
12679: And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
12680: aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it
12681: not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
12682: miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
12683: 
12684: Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
12685: ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
12686: them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then
12687: jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what
12688: seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another
12689: protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and
12690: Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
12691: whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
12692: reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
12693: benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but
12694: in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that
12695: both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled
12696: water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a
12697: leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping
12698: there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed
12699: to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
12700: 
12701: Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
12702: and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters
12703: it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
12704: in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
12705: sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
12706: and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
12707: 
12708: But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,
12709: as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
12710: climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
12711: trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
12712: consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye
12713: gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
12714: 
12715: “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
12716: “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then
12717: standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
12718: astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have
12719: the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
12720: ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
12721: kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is
12722: ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what
12723: the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor
12724: Queequeg here.”
12725: 
12726: “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
12727: business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
12728: come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,
12729: if you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The
12730: steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to
12731: Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an
12732: apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
12733: which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
12734: 
12735: “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
12736: 
12737: “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a
12738: harpooneer; none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison
12739: us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
12740: us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”
12741: 
12742: “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the
12743: ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,
12744: but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
12745: 
12746: “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
12747: the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
12748: Starbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a
12749: whale.”
12750: 
12751: “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”
12752: 
12753: “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
12754: that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,
12755: sir?”
12756: 
12757: “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
12758: 
12759: When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
12760: sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and
12761: was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that
12762: was freely given to the waves.
12763: 
12764: 
12765: CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk
12766: over Him.
12767: 
12768: It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s
12769: prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it
12770: continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
12771: it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for
12772: the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
12773: 
12774: Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
12775: drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
12776: gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
12777: Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
12778: anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
12779: those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to
12780: cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
12781: the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had
12782: been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
12783: announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,
12784: if opportunity offered.
12785: 
12786: Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
12787: boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further
12788: and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
12789: the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
12790: tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
12791: both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
12792: plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
12793: towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first
12794: it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
12795: maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
12796: view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the
12797: ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
12798: brought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty
12799: of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
12800: paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
12801: might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle
12802: was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened
12803: line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the
12804: contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few
12805: feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did
12806: gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
12807: along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,
12808: suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
12809: flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken
12810: glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once
12811: more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,
12812: and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship
12813: towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
12814: circuit.
12815: 
12816: Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
12817: flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;
12818: and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
12819: multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body,
12820: rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
12821: new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains
12822: that poured from the smitten rock.
12823: 
12824: At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
12825: turned upon his back a corpse.
12826: 
12827: While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
12828: and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
12829: conversation ensued between them.
12830: 
12831: “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said
12832: Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
12833: ignoble a leviathan.
12834: 
12835: “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,
12836: “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s
12837: head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right
12838: Whale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can
12839: never afterwards capsize?”
12840: 
12841: “Why not?
12842: 
12843: “I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,
12844: and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think
12845: he’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,
12846: Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved
12847: into a snake’s head, Stubb?”
12848: 
12849: “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
12850: dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
12851: down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
12852: hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
12853: disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
12854: stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you
12855: don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries
12856: it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of
12857: it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
12858: 
12859: “He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve
12860: seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
12861: 
12862: “No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
12863: see, in the eye of the rigging.”
12864: 
12865: “What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
12866: 
12867: “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
12868: 
12869: “Bargain?—about what?”
12870: 
12871: “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
12872: the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
12873: his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
12874: he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”
12875: 
12876: “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
12877: 
12878: “I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
12879: one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old
12880: flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
12881: gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he
12882: was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching
12883: his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old
12884: governor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting
12885: mad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the
12886: Lord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before
12887: he got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look
12888: sharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get
12889: the whale alongside.”
12890: 
12891: “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,
12892: when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
12893: towards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”
12894: 
12895: “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?
12896: Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
12897: 
12898: “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
12899: Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
12900: the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
12901: 
12902: “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live
12903: for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any
12904: parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a
12905: latch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can
12906: crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
12907: 
12908: “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
12909: 
12910: “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s
12911: the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string
12912: along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that
12913: wouldn’t begin to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in creation
12914: couldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
12915: 
12916: “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
12917: meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if
12918: he’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to
12919: live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me
12920: that?
12921: 
12922: “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
12923: 
12924: “But he’d crawl back.”
12925: 
12926: “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
12927: 
12928: “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and
12929: drown you—what then?”
12930: 
12931: “I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black
12932: eyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin
12933: again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
12934: lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn
12935: the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid
12936: of him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in
12937: double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
12938: people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
12939: kidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a governor!”
12940: 
12941: “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
12942: 
12943: “Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now
12944: to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious
12945: going on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look
12946: here, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord
12947: I’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
12948: and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come
12949: short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he
12950: finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the
12951: poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
12952: 
12953: “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
12954: 
12955: “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
12956: 
12957: “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
12958: 
12959: “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
12960: 
12961: The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
12962: where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
12963: securing him.
12964: 
12965: “Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right
12966: whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”
12967: 
12968: In good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
12969: leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of
12970: both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
12971: well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go
12972: over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come
12973: back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
12974: trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
12975: and then you will float light and right.
12976: 
12977: In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
12978: ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
12979: case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
12980: off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed
12981: and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to
12982: what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present
12983: case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;
12984: and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair
12985: of overburdening panniers.
12986: 
12987: Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever
12988: and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
12989: hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
12990: shadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only
12991: to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish
12992: speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
12993: things.
12994: 
12995: 
12996: CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
12997: 
12998: Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
12999: join them, and lay together our own.
13000: 
13001: Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
13002: Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales
13003: regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two
13004: extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external
13005: difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
13006: head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we
13007: may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
13008: deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to
13009: study practical cetology than here?
13010: 
13011: In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
13012: these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a
13013: certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right
13014: Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.
13015: As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to
13016: him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this
13017: dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the
13018: summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he
13019: is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
13020: 
13021: Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two
13022: most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the
13023: head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you
13024: narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
13025: fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
13026: magnitude of the head.
13027: 
13028: Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is
13029: plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
13030: than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s
13031: eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for
13032: yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects
13033: through your ears. You would find that you could only command some
13034: thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
13035: and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking
13036: straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not
13037: be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
13038: behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
13039: same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes
13040: the front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?
13041: 
13042: Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
13043: are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
13044: produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of
13045: the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
13046: solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
13047: two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the
13048: impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,
13049: must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
13050: picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and
13051: nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the
13052: world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with
13053: the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two
13054: distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the
13055: whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and
13056: to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.
13057: 
13058: A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
13059: visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
13060: hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
13061: is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
13062: whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience
13063: will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
13064: things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and
13065: completely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at
13066: one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side
13067: and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two
13068: objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
13069: order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
13070: bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
13071: consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in
13072: themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
13073: comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the
13074: same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on
13075: one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he
13076: can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
13077: simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
13078: problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
13079: incongruity in this comparison.
13080: 
13081: It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
13082: extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
13083: beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
13084: frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
13085: proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
13086: divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.
13087: 
13088: But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
13089: entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
13090: hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
13091: whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
13092: wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
13093: respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
13094: between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has
13095: an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
13096: over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
13097: 
13098: Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
13099: world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
13100: which is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens
13101: of Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
13102: cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
13103: hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
13104: Subtilize it.
13105: 
13106: Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
13107: over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
13108: by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
13109: that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
13110: might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But
13111: let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What
13112: a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
13113: lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
13114: bridal satins.
13115: 
13116: But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
13117: like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one
13118: end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
13119: and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,
13120: alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
13121: spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,
13122: when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
13123: suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
13124: straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a
13125: ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of
13126: sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his
13127: jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
13128: reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
13129: him.
13130: 
13131: In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised
13132: artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
13133: the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
13134: with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
13135: including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
13136: 
13137: With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
13138: anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
13139: work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
13140: are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances
13141: the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
13142: rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
13143: stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally
13144: forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;
13145: nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn
13146: into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.
13147: 
13148: 
13149: CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
13150: 
13151: Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right
13152: Whale’s head.
13153: 
13154: As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a
13155: Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
13156: rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather
13157: inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred
13158: years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
13159: shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the
13160: nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
13161: lodged, she and all her progeny.
13162: 
13163: But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
13164: aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit
13165: and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole
13166: head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in
13167: its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
13168: crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,
13169: barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the
13170: Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes
13171: solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
13172: with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those
13173: live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
13174: sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
13175: technical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
13176: take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
13177: diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
13178: him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a
13179: very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower
13180: lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by
13181: carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a
13182: sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.
13183: 
13184: A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
13185: The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an
13186: important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
13187: earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery
13188: threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at
13189: Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good
13190: Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet
13191: high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular
13192: ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us
13193: with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,
13194: say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the
13195: head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere
13196: been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with
13197: hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in
13198: whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes
13199: through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of
13200: bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious
13201: marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the
13202: creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the
13203: certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the
13204: savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we
13205: must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance
13206: will seem reasonable.
13207: 
13208: In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
13209: concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
13210: “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
13211: third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
13212: “There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
13213: upper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”
13214: 
13215: *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
13216: rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
13217: upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts
13218: impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
13219: countenance.
13220: 
13221: As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
13222: “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
13223: other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
13224: long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was
13225: in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those
13226: ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as
13227: you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
13228: nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
13229: tent spread over the same bone.
13230: 
13231: But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
13232: standing in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all
13233: these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not
13234: think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
13235: thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
13236: Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
13237: mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
13238: it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
13239: should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that
13240: amount of oil.
13241: 
13242: Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
13243: with—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
13244: different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no
13245: great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
13246: of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are
13247: there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
13248: anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external
13249: spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
13250: 
13251: Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
13252: lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other
13253: will not be very long in following.
13254: 
13255: Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same
13256: he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now
13257: faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
13258: placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the
13259: other head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by
13260: accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.
13261: Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical
13262: resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a
13263: Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in
13264: his latter years.
13265: 
13266: 
13267: CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
13268: 
13269: Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,
13270: as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
13271: aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you
13272: investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
13273: unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may
13274: be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either
13275: satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an
13276: infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,
13277: perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.
13278: 
13279: You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,
13280: the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
13281: water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
13282: considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long
13283: socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the
13284: mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as
13285: though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you
13286: observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
13287: has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes
13288: and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire
13289: length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the
13290: front of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single
13291: organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are
13292: now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part
13293: of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and
13294: not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the
13295: full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is
13296: as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents
13297: partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised
13298: of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that
13299: apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how
13300: the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.
13301: Just so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this
13302: envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable
13303: by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the
13304: sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds
13305: from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved
13306: with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
13307: 
13308: Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
13309: chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
13310: sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
13311: contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold
13312: there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and
13313: toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
13314: would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
13315: itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But
13316: supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as
13317: ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
13318: capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,
13319: as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the
13320: otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
13321: altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated
13322: out of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its
13323: envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has
13324: hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled
13325: honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
13326: unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
13327: atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
13328: irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
13329: destructive of all elements contributes.
13330: 
13331: Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
13332: wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
13333: mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
13334: is—by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest
13335: insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the
13336: specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
13337: expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more
13338: inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
13339: ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
13340: Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
13341: the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
13342: eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
13343: sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
13344: giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
13345: then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’s veil
13346: at Lais?
13347: 
13348: 
13349: CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
13350: 
13351: Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
13352: know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
13353: upon.
13354: 
13355: Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
13356: inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower
13357: is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
13358: unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
13359: expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
13360: forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
13361: almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
13362: wall of a thick tendinous substance.
13363: 
13364: *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
13365: mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
13366: solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
13367: steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
13368: sides.
13369: 
13370: The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
13371: oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
13372: infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
13373: extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great
13374: Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is
13375: mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms
13376: innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
13377: wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished
13378: with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun
13379: of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily
13380: vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,
13381: limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found
13382: unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains
13383: perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon
13384: begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when
13385: the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s
13386: case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
13387: unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
13388: dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish
13389: business of securing what you can.
13390: 
13391: I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
13392: coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
13393: possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
13394: the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm
13395: Whale’s case.
13396: 
13397: It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
13398: embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as
13399: has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole
13400: length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
13401: for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the
13402: depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a
13403: ship’s side.
13404: 
13405: As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought
13406: close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
13407: spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest
13408: a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly
13409: let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the
13410: head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in
13411: that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
13412: combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that
13413: quarter.
13414: 
13415: Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
13416: this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
13417: Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.
13418: 
13419: 
13420: CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
13421: 
13422: Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
13423: posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the
13424: part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried
13425: with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
13426: travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that
13427: it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
13428: is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
13429: the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
13430: lands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the
13431: rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish
13432: Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
13433: short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches
13434: for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business
13435: he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
13436: sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time
13437: this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
13438: a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
13439: other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
13440: three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the
13441: Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
13442: Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
13443: bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word
13444: to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like
13445: a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the
13446: full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly
13447: emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through
13448: the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the
13449: end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper
13450: and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone
13451: down.
13452: 
13453: Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
13454: several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once
13455: a queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild
13456: Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his
13457: one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or
13458: whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
13459: whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
13460: stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling
13461: now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came
13462: suckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket
13463: in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of
13464: Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of
13465: sight!
13466: 
13467: “Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
13468: came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot
13469: into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
13470: itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
13471: before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there
13472: was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before
13473: lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,
13474: as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
13475: the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
13476: depth to which he had sunk.
13477: 
13478: At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
13479: the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a
13480: sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,
13481: one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a
13482: vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
13483: reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
13484: upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
13485: on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
13486: motions of the head.
13487: 
13488: “Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
13489: holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
13490: would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
13491: rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
13492: buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
13493: 
13494: “In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
13495: there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on
13496: top of his head? Avast, will ye!”
13497: 
13498: “Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a
13499: rocket.
13500: 
13501: Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
13502: dropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the
13503: suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
13504: copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the
13505: sailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of
13506: spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
13507: buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the
13508: sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked
13509: figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
13510: hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my
13511: brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the
13512: side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,
13513: and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands
13514: now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the
13515: ship.
13516: 
13517: “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
13518: overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
13519: upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
13520: forth from the grass over a grave.
13521: 
13522: “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and
13523: soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
13524: with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the
13525: waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
13526: long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
13527: 
13528: Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
13529: slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side
13530: lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
13531: dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
13532: and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
13533: thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
13534: was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had
13535: thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
13536: somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
13537: the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was
13538: doing as well as could be expected.
13539: 
13540: And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
13541: Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was
13542: successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and
13543: apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be
13544: forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing
13545: and boxing, riding and rowing.
13546: 
13547: I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to
13548: seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
13549: either seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an
13550: accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
13551: the Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
13552: Sperm Whale’s well.
13553: 
13554: But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
13555: the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
13556: most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
13557: a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
13558: all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had
13559: been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the
13560: dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,
13561: as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of
13562: which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking
13563: in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted
13564: by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it
13565: sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair
13566: chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.
13567: Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.
13568: 
13569: Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
13570: perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
13571: spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
13572: and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
13573: recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey
13574: in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that
13575: leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
13576: many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and
13577: sweetly perished there?
13578: 
13579: 
13580: CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
13581: 
13582: To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
13583: Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
13584: as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as
13585: for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,
13586: or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the
13587: Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of
13588: the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of
13589: horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the
13590: modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his
13591: disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
13592: phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
13593: though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of
13594: these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all
13595: things; I achieve what I can.
13596: 
13597: Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
13598: has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most
13599: conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
13600: finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
13601: its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
13602: the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,
13603: cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
13604: to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in
13605: keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the
13606: nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!
13607: Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his
13608: proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
13609: sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is
13610: an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As
13611: on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your
13612: jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the
13613: reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
13614: so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
13615: royal beadle on his throne.
13616: 
13617: In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
13618: be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This
13619: aspect is sublime.
13620: 
13621: In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
13622: morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has
13623: a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
13624: the elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is
13625: as that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their
13626: decrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most
13627: creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip
13628: of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which
13629: like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,
13630: that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;
13631: and all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the
13632: antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters
13633: track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this
13634: high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely
13635: amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the
13636: Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other
13637: object in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one
13638: distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;
13639: he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a
13640: forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,
13641: and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;
13642: though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In
13643: profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
13644: depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark
13645: of genius.
13646: 
13647: But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
13648: book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
13649: nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his
13650: pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale
13651: been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by
13652: their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,
13653: because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,
13654: or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
13655: protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall
13656: lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and
13657: livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now
13658: unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat, the great
13659: Sperm Whale shall lord it.
13660: 
13661: Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is
13662: no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s
13663: face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
13664: fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could
13665: not read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle
13666: meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of
13667: the Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you
13668: can.
13669: 
13670: 
13671: CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
13672: 
13673: If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
13674: his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
13675: square.
13676: 
13677: In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
13678: in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as
13679: the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
13680: base. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is
13681: angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
13682: mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
13683: bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in
13684: another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
13685: depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at
13686: least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away
13687: behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
13688: amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it
13689: secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
13690: that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
13691: of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in
13692: strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it
13693: seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
13694: mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.
13695: 
13696: It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in
13697: the creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
13698: true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The
13699: whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
13700: common world.
13701: 
13702: If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
13703: of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
13704: resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
13705: the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down
13706: to the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would
13707: involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on
13708: one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man
13709: had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,
13710: considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
13711: power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
13712: exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.
13713: 
13714: But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you
13715: deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
13716: for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you
13717: will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung
13718: necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
13719: skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely
13720: undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the
13721: Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
13722: pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
13723: the vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the
13724: beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have
13725: omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
13726: cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s
13727: character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
13728: your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine
13729: never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in
13730: the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the
13731: world.
13732: 
13733: Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
13734: cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
13735: the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
13736: eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As
13737: it passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but
13738: for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,
13739: this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
13740: spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And
13741: what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s
13742: cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal
13743: to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be
13744: unreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?
13745: For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
13746: brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
13747: magnitude of his spinal cord.
13748: 
13749: But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
13750: would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
13751: Sperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
13752: of the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
13753: convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call
13754: this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm
13755: Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have
13756: reason to know.
13757: 
13758: 
13759: CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
13760: 
13761: The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
13762: Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.
13763: 
13764: At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
13765: Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
13766: intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
13767: their flag in the Pacific.
13768: 
13769: For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
13770: While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
13771: boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
13772: bows instead of the stern.
13773: 
13774: “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
13775: wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”
13776: 
13777: “Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s
13778: coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
13779: tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all
13780: right, is the Yarman.”
13781: 
13782: “Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
13783: He’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”
13784: 
13785: However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
13786: whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
13787: proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
13788: really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
13789: indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
13790: 
13791: As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
13792: heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
13793: soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
13794: turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
13795: remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
13796: profound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
13797: single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by
13798: hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically
13799: called a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name
13800: of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
13801: 
13802: His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
13803: ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
13804: mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
13805: without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed
13806: round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
13807: 
13808: Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
13809: boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
13810: Pequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their
13811: danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before
13812: the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in
13813: harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling
13814: a great wide parchment upon the sea.
13815: 
13816: Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
13817: humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
13818: by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
13819: afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this
13820: whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
13821: not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
13822: Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
13823: must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
13824: muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
13825: currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth
13826: with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,
13827: followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to
13828: have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind
13829: him to upbubble.
13830: 
13831: “Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
13832: afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse
13833: winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind
13834: I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so
13835: before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”
13836: 
13837: As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
13838: load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
13839: way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
13840: turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
13841: wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost
13842: that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
13843: 
13844: “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
13845: arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
13846: 
13847: “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the
13848: German will have him.”
13849: 
13850: With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
13851: fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
13852: valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
13853: going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for
13854: the time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three
13855: German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
13856: Derick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
13857: foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being
13858: already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
13859: before they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he
13860: seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally
13861: with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.
13862: 
13863: “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and
13864: dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
13865: ago!”—then in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to
13866: it!”
13867: 
13868: “I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against my
13869: religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous
13870: Yarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye
13871: love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why
13872: don’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an
13873: anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s
13874: grass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s
13875: budding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long
13876: of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”
13877: 
13878: “Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What a
13879: hump—Oh, _do_ pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, _do_
13880: spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked clams
13881: and muffins—oh, _do_, _do_, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose
13882: him now—don’t oh, _don’t!_—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t ye pull for your
13883: duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye love sperm? There
13884: goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The bank of
13885: England!—Oh, _do_, _do_, _do!_—What’s that Yarman about now?”
13886: 
13887: At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
13888: advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
13889: retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically
13890: accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
13891: 
13892: “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
13893: thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
13894: Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
13895: for the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
13896: 
13897: “I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.
13898: 
13899: Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s
13900: three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
13901: momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
13902: headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
13903: proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating
13904: cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down
13905: with the Yarman! Sail over him!”
13906: 
13907: But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
13908: their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
13909: a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the
13910: blade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to
13911: free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh
13912: to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that
13913: was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took
13914: a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s
13915: quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the
13916: whale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was
13917: the foaming swell that he made.
13918: 
13919: It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was
13920: now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
13921: tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
13922: fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
13923: flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank
13924: in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So
13925: have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles
13926: in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird
13927: has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the
13928: fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted
13929: in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his
13930: spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while
13931: still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there
13932: was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.
13933: 
13934: Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s
13935: boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick
13936: chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long
13937: dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.
13938: 
13939: But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
13940: three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their
13941: feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
13942: barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
13943: Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
13944: white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong
13945: rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and
13946: his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three
13947: flying keels.
13948: 
13949: “Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing
13950: glance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all
13951: right—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
13952: distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel
13953: a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
13954: mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a
13955: tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to
13956: him that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you
13957: strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going
13958: to Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this
13959: whale carries the everlasting mail!”
13960: 
13961: But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
13962: tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round
13963: the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
13964: while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
13965: soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
13966: caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
13967: last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
13968: the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the
13969: gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
13970: sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for
13971: some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more
13972: line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have
13973: been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as
13974: it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
13975: the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising
13976: again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the
13977: peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always
13978: the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the
13979: stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,
13980: owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale
13981: something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is
13982: immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
13983: ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how
13984: vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two
13985: hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty
13986: atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty
13987: line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
13988: board.
13989: 
13990: As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
13991: into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
13992: sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
13993: what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
13994: placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
13995: agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
13996: Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan
13997: was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and
13998: to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was
13999: once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
14000: or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him
14001: cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron
14002: as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
14003: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh!
14004: that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of
14005: a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the
14006: mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!
14007: 
14008: In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
14009: sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
14010: enough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the
14011: wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
14012: 
14013: “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
14014: vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
14015: magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
14016: oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
14017: from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
14018: upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
14019: scared from it into the sea.
14020: 
14021: “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”
14022: 
14023: The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
14024: could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
14025: dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
14026: ship’s lengths of the hunters.
14027: 
14028: His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land
14029: animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,
14030: whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly
14031: shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose
14032: peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the
14033: blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a
14034: harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial
14035: system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of
14036: water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to
14037: pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of
14038: blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that
14039: he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even
14040: as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs
14041: of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled
14042: upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the
14043: lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the
14044: new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
14045: spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending
14046: its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet
14047: came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,
14048: as they significantly call it, was untouched.
14049: 
14050: As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
14051: his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
14052: revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
14053: beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the
14054: noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes
14055: had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
14056: But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his
14057: blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light
14058: the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate
14059: the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to
14060: all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a
14061: strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low
14062: down on the flank.
14063: 
14064: “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
14065: 
14066: “Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”
14067: 
14068: But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an
14069: ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
14070: than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift
14071: fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying
14072: crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring
14073: the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he
14074: by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
14075: made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
14076: then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the
14077: white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most
14078: piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is
14079: gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled
14080: melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
14081: ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.
14082: 
14083: Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
14084: showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
14085: Immediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at
14086: different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
14087: whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very
14088: heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred
14089: to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest
14090: fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the
14091: body would at once sink to the bottom.
14092: 
14093: It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
14094: the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his
14095: flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the
14096: stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured
14097: whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence
14098: of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have
14099: been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
14100: the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
14101: lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
14102: the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And
14103: when? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before
14104: America was discovered.
14105: 
14106: What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
14107: cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further
14108: discoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
14109: to the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.
14110: However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to
14111: the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the
14112: ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with
14113: the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such
14114: was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the
14115: fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast
14116: them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the
14117: other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a
14118: house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her
14119: bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
14120: dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the
14121: immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so
14122: low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at
14123: all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed
14124: added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going
14125: over.
14126: 
14127: “Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in
14128: such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something
14129: or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,
14130: and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big
14131: chains.”
14132: 
14133: “Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
14134: hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
14135: at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were
14136: given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific
14137: snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
14138: 
14139: Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
14140: Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
14141: accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
14142: buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
14143: surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
14144: broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
14145: bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
14146: this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
14147: sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it
14148: is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
14149: noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of
14150: life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,
14151: buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
14152: 
14153: Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
14154: accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
14155: Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable
14156: in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;
14157: his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
14158: incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances
14159: where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
14160: again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is
14161: obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
14162: magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship
14163: could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,
14164: among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of
14165: sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when
14166: the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall
14167: have ascended again.
14168: 
14169: It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
14170: the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again
14171: lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
14172: Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
14173: its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is
14174: so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is
14175: often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were
14176: now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all
14177: sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared
14178: far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.
14179: 
14180: Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.
14181: 
14182: 
14183: CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.
14184: 
14185: There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
14186: true method.
14187: 
14188: The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up
14189: to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its
14190: great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many
14191: great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
14192: have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection
14193: that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a
14194: fraternity.
14195: 
14196: The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
14197: the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale
14198: attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
14199: Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms
14200: to succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one
14201: knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely
14202: Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,
14203: and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the
14204: prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and
14205: delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,
14206: rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as
14207: this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt
14208: this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian
14209: coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast
14210: skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants
14211: asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.
14212: When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in
14213: triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this
14214: story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
14215: 
14216: Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed
14217: to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. George and
14218: the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many
14219: old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and
14220: often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
14221: dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in
14222: truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it
14223: would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but
14224: encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle
14225: with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only
14226: a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march
14227: boldly up to a whale.
14228: 
14229: Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
14230: creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
14231: represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted
14232: on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance
14233: of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;
14234: and considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have
14235: crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
14236: ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
14237: bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
14238: with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
14239: hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.
14240: In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story
14241: will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,
14242: Dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s
14243: head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the
14244: stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble
14245: stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by
14246: good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most
14247: noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that
14248: honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do
14249: with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer
14250: with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we
14251: are much better entitled to St. George’s decoration than they.
14252: 
14253: Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
14254: remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
14255: antique Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good
14256: deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that
14257: strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere
14258: appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from
14259: the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
14260: whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I
14261: claim him for one of our clan.
14262: 
14263: But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
14264: Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
14265: ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly
14266: they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the
14267: prophet?
14268: 
14269: Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
14270: roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like
14271: royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in
14272: nothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental
14273: story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread
14274: Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives
14275: us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first
14276: of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified
14277: the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved
14278: to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave
14279: birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical
14280: books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo
14281: before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
14282: something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
14283: Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
14284: incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
14285: rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even
14286: as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?
14287: 
14288: Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a
14289: member-roll for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like
14290: that?
14291: 
14292: 
14293: CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
14294: 
14295: Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in
14296: the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
14297: historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some
14298: sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans
14299: of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,
14300: and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did
14301: not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
14302: 
14303: One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
14304: story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
14305: embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
14306: Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with
14307: respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
14308: varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this
14309: saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.
14310: But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not
14311: necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the
14312: whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And
14313: this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right
14314: Whale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and
14315: comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have
14316: ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right
14317: Whale is toothless.
14318: 
14319: Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
14320: want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
14321: reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But
14322: this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
14323: supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
14324: _dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
14325: their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has
14326: been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was
14327: thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
14328: escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a
14329: figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some
14330: craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor
14331: have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the
14332: whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an
14333: inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was
14334: saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all
14335: round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was
14336: this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the
14337: Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
14338: within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much
14339: more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the
14340: Mediterranean coast. How is that?
14341: 
14342: But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
14343: that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by
14344: the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage
14345: through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up
14346: the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the
14347: complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of
14348: the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any
14349: whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of
14350: Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of
14351: that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and
14352: so make modern history a liar.
14353: 
14354: But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
14355: foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
14356: that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
14357: sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
14358: abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a
14359: Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh
14360: via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the
14361: general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly
14362: enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.
14363: And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s
14364: Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which
14365: Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.
14366: 
14367: 
14368: CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
14369: 
14370: To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
14371: anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
14372: analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it
14373: to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
14374: be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are
14375: hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
14376: make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing
14377: his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
14378: disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;
14379: crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in
14380: the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair
14381: from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to
14382: some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the
14383: event.
14384: 
14385: Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
14386: them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
14387: flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.
14388: 
14389: Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
14390: exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
14391: stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
14392: flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
14393: planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
14394: imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
14395: haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
14396: furious. What then remained?
14397: 
14398: Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
14399: countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
14400: none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
14401: sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It
14402: is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact
14403: and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
14404: accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
14405: headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or
14406: twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the
14407: harpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a
14408: small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be
14409: hauled back to the hand after darting.
14410: 
14411: But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
14412: the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is
14413: seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on
14414: account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
14415: compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a
14416: general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before
14417: any pitchpoling comes into play.
14418: 
14419: Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
14420: equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
14421: in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
14422: flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet
14423: ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along
14424: its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers
14425: up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in
14426: his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full
14427: before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,
14428: covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,
14429: thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon
14430: his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
14431: balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless
14432: impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
14433: distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of
14434: sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
14435: 
14436: “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
14437: Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old
14438: Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,
14439: Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink
14440: round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the
14441: spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
14442: living stuff.”
14443: 
14444: Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
14445: the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
14446: leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is
14447: slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and
14448: mutely watches the monster die.
14449: 
14450: 
14451: CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
14452: 
14453: That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages
14454: before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and
14455: sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many
14456: sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
14457: thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
14458: whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should
14459: be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter
14460: minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.
14461: 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,
14462: after all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a
14463: noteworthy thing.
14464: 
14465: Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
14466: contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
14467: gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
14468: is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a
14469: cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
14470: surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
14471: regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by
14472: inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the
14473: necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot
14474: in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,
14475: the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the
14476: surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his
14477: mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the
14478: top of his head.
14479: 
14480: If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
14481: indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
14482: certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the
14483: blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I
14484: shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
14485: Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
14486: aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
14487: fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then
14488: live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
14489: case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
14490: hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or
14491: so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has
14492: no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine
14493: he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
14494: vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are
14495: completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or
14496: more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of
14497: vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert
14498: carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
14499: supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
14500: indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable
14501: and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
14502: inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,
14503: as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon
14504: rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period
14505: of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he
14506: stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy
14507: breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his
14508: seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few
14509: breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up
14510: again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those
14511: seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full
14512: term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates
14513: are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale
14514: thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
14515: his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,
14516: that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal
14517: hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast
14518: leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the
14519: sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great
14520: necessities that strike the victory to thee!
14521: 
14522: In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for
14523: two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
14524: attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
14525: Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
14526: 
14527: It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
14528: if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
14529: then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
14530: smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
14531: all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
14532: clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
14533: of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water
14534: or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
14535: on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no
14536: proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no
14537: violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.
14538: 
14539: Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
14540: canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished
14541: with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of
14542: air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;
14543: unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he
14544: talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?
14545: Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this
14546: world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
14547: living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
14548: 
14549: Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is
14550: for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
14551: horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
14552: to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
14553: in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether
14554: this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout
14555: of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether
14556: that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and
14557: discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth
14558: indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be
14559: proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the
14560: spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,
14561: when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s
14562: food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he
14563: would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
14564: watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating
14565: rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of
14566: respiration.
14567: 
14568: But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
14569: You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
14570: tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
14571: settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the
14572: knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand
14573: in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
14574: 
14575: The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
14576: it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
14577: when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
14578: of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all
14579: around him. And if at such times you should think that you really
14580: perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
14581: not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are
14582: not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
14583: fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For
14584: even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with
14585: his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,
14586: the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a
14587: blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
14588: rain.
14589: 
14590: Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
14591: precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
14592: into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
14593: this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
14594: slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will
14595: often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
14596: the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer
14597: contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or
14598: otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
14599: Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to
14600: evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt
14601: it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind
14602: you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
14603: to let this deadly spout alone.
14604: 
14605: Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
14606: hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides
14607: other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
14608: touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I
14609: account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
14610: fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
14611: whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am
14612: convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
14613: Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes
14614: up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep
14615: thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the
14616: curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected
14617: there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over
14618: my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep
14619: thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an
14620: August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above
14621: supposition.
14622: 
14623: And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
14624: behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
14625: head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
14626: contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified
14627: by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
14628: For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate
14629: vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
14630: mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a
14631: heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
14632: but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of
14633: all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this
14634: combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
14635: regards them both with equal eye.
14636: 
14637: 
14638: CHAPTER 86. The Tail.
14639: 
14640: Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
14641: and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,
14642: I celebrate a tail.
14643: 
14644: Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point
14645: of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
14646: upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.
14647: The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat
14648: palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in
14649: thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,
14650: then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy
14651: between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
14652: defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost
14653: expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed
14654: twenty feet across.
14655: 
14656: The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
14657: into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
14658: middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long
14659: and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
14660: crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as
14661: anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman
14662: walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
14663: course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
14664: relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
14665: great strength of the masonry.
14666: 
14667: But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
14668: the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
14669: muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
14670: and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
14671: largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
14672: measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
14673: Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.
14674: 
14675: Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful
14676: flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a
14677: Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most
14678: appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or
14679: harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly
14680: beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied
14681: tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved
14682: Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the
14683: linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with
14684: the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.
14685: When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what
14686: robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in
14687: the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which
14688: his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so
14689: destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but
14690: the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on
14691: all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his
14692: teachings.
14693: 
14694: Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
14695: wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
14696: be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein
14697: no fairy’s arm can transcend it.
14698: 
14699: Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
14700: progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
14701: Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
14702: 
14703: First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a
14704: different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
14705: wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
14706: whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
14707: forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is
14708: this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster
14709: when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
14710: 
14711: Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
14712: fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
14713: conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In
14714: striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
14715: blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed
14716: air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
14717: irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only
14718: salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the
14719: opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the
14720: whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a
14721: dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the
14722: most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received
14723: in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one
14724: strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
14725: 
14726: Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
14727: the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
14728: there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
14729: elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
14730: sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
14731: slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
14732: the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,
14733: whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!
14734: Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of
14735: Darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low
14736: salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their
14737: zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
14738: possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet
14739: another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his
14740: trunk and extracted the dart.
14741: 
14742: Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
14743: middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
14744: of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
14745: hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his
14746: tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
14747: thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a
14748: great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of
14749: vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that
14750: that was the smoke from the touch-hole.
14751: 
14752: Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
14753: lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
14754: out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into
14755: the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
14756: tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
14757: downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere
14758: else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the
14759: grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
14760: profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
14761: highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting
14762: forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in
14763: gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the
14764: Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the
14765: archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
14766: crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
14767: all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
14768: peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
14769: of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of
14770: the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African
14771: elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most
14772: devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military
14773: elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks
14774: uplifted in the profoundest silence.
14775: 
14776: The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
14777: elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
14778: of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite
14779: organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
14780: respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to
14781: Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the
14782: stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were
14783: as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and
14784: crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated
14785: instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
14786: oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his
14787: balls.*
14788: 
14789: *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
14790: the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
14791: elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
14792: to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
14793: curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the
14794: elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
14795: elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.
14796: 
14797: The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my
14798: inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,
14799: though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
14800: inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
14801: these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them
14802: akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these
14803: methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting
14804: other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,
14805: and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I
14806: may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I
14807: know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much
14808: more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my
14809: back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.
14810: But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will
14811: about his face, I say again he has no face.
14812: 
14813: 
14814: CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
14815: 
14816: The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
14817: the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.
14818: In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
14819: Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast
14820: mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and
14821: dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded
14822: oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
14823: for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are
14824: the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,
14825: vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.
14826: 
14827: Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
14828: midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
14829: promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond
14830: to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
14831: considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,
14832: and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
14833: sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
14834: treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
14835: appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping
14836: western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with
14837: those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
14838: Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these
14839: Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from
14840: the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
14841: past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra
14842: and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while
14843: they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
14844: their claim to more solid tribute.
14845: 
14846: Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
14847: low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
14848: vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
14849: point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
14850: have received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these
14851: corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present
14852: day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in
14853: those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
14854: 
14855: With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
14856: straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
14857: thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
14858: and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,
14859: and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season
14860: there. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost
14861: all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to
14862: descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere
14863: else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby
14864: Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he
14865: might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.
14866: 
14867: But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
14868: crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,
14869: now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs
14870: no sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the
14871: whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
14872: transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
14873: no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a
14874: whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
14875: utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She
14876: carries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,
14877: when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to
14878: drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,
14879: from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other
14880: ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at
14881: a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have
14882: sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating
14883: seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that
14884: another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the
14885: ark!”
14886: 
14887: Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
14888: Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of
14889: the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
14890: excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and
14891: more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
14892: admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the
14893: land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the
14894: fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was
14895: descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
14896: hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
14897: customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
14898: of singular magnificence saluted us.
14899: 
14900: But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
14901: which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
14902: Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
14903: companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive
14904: herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost
14905: seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and
14906: covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of
14907: the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the
14908: circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now
14909: sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by
14910: a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems
14911: thousands on thousands.
14912: 
14913: Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
14914: forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
14915: continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
14916: noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
14917: Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the
14918: cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of
14919: the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
14920: rising and falling away to leeward.
14921: 
14922: Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
14923: the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the
14924: air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
14925: like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
14926: of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
14927: 
14928: As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
14929: accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
14930: their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
14931: plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward
14932: through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
14933: semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
14934: 
14935: Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
14936: handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet
14937: suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
14938: chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy
14939: into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
14940: number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby
14941: Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
14942: white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with
14943: stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
14944: before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly
14945: directing attention to something in our wake.
14946: 
14947: Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
14948: rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling
14949: something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
14950: completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
14951: disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved
14952: in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to
14953: wet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”
14954: 
14955: As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
14956: fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in
14957: hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the
14958: swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how
14959: very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on
14960: to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that
14961: they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in
14962: his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one
14963: the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above
14964: seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery
14965: defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that
14966: through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that
14967: through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his
14968: deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates
14969: and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with
14970: their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,
14971: Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after
14972: some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the
14973: firm thing from its place.
14974: 
14975: But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
14976: when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
14977: Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
14978: side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
14979: harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
14980: gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
14981: victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake
14982: of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the
14983: ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to
14984: spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed
14985: wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three
14986: keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than
14987: they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that
14988: their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved
14989: on with redoubled velocity.
14990: 
14991: Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
14992: after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
14993: chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
14994: token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
14995: perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it
14996: in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in
14997: which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
14998: broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in
14999: the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with
15000: consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,
15001: and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick
15002: spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was
15003: still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely
15004: paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled
15005: ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple
15006: sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not
15007: possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
15008: timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though
15009: banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the
15010: West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human
15011: beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,
15012: they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the
15013: outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each
15014: other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the
15015: strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts
15016: of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
15017: 
15018: Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
15019: yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
15020: retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
15021: those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
15022: whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
15023: Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
15024: in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
15025: straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part
15026: of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise
15027: unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;
15028: yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the
15029: fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the
15030: frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a
15031: delirious throb.
15032: 
15033: As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
15034: speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
15035: thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
15036: the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
15037: like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
15038: through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
15039: moment it may be locked in and crushed.
15040: 
15041: But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
15042: from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away
15043: from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
15044: time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
15045: way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no
15046: time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their
15047: wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to
15048: the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried
15049: one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
15050: and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,
15051: there!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
15052: calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.
15053: 
15054: All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
15055: by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of
15056: equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
15057: other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
15058: attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
15059: being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is
15060: chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more
15061: whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But
15062: sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you
15063: must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you
15064: must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.
15065: Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into
15066: requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and
15067: second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly
15068: running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing
15069: drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But
15070: upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy
15071: wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an
15072: instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
15073: boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea
15074: came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and
15075: shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
15076: 
15077: It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it
15078: not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly
15079: diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
15080: the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So
15081: that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale
15082: sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
15083: momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the
15084: shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
15085: valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost
15086: whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea
15087: presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by
15088: the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.
15089: Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the
15090: heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we
15091: beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive
15092: pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,
15093: like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to
15094: shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
15095: middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the
15096: density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding
15097: the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at
15098: present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that
15099: hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us
15100: up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by
15101: small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.
15102: 
15103: Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
15104: outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
15105: any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
15106: the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
15107: miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be
15108: deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed
15109: playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
15110: circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
15111: locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd
15112: had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
15113: stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
15114: innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller
15115: whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
15116: lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
15117: becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like
15118: household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,
15119: and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
15120: domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched
15121: their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the
15122: time refrained from darting it.
15123: 
15124: But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
15125: stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended
15126: in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
15127: whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
15128: mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
15129: exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will
15130: calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two
15131: different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,
15132: be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so
15133: did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at
15134: us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.
15135: Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One
15136: of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a
15137: day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six
15138: feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed
15139: scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately
15140: occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready
15141: for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.
15142: The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly
15143: retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived
15144: from foreign parts.
15145: 
15146: “Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him
15147: fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”
15148: 
15149: “What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.
15150: 
15151: “Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.
15152: 
15153: As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
15154: of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
15155: shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
15156: towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord
15157: of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to
15158: its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this
15159: natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the
15160: hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest
15161: secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We
15162: saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*
15163: 
15164: *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
15165: unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
15166: gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
15167: one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an
15168: Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
15169: curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
15170: themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious
15171: parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s
15172: pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk
15173: is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
15174: with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales
15175: salute _more hominum_.
15176: 
15177: And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
15178: affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
15179: fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
15180: in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of
15181: my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
15182: and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
15183: and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
15184: 
15185: Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
15186: spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
15187: still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
15188: possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
15189: of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
15190: of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
15191: across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is
15192: sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
15193: and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
15194: maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled
15195: cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A
15196: whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not
15197: effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying
15198: along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony
15199: of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the
15200: lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying
15201: dismay wherever he went.
15202: 
15203: But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
15204: spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed
15205: to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first
15206: the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived
15207: that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale
15208: had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
15209: away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope
15210: attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
15211: harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
15212: from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning
15213: through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and
15214: tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own
15215: comrades.
15216: 
15217: This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
15218: stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
15219: began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by
15220: half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to
15221: heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
15222: in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
15223: circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was
15224: departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
15225: tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in
15226: Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner
15227: centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly
15228: Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.
15229: 
15230: “Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your
15231: oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
15232: you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,
15233: and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape
15234: them!—scrape away!”
15235: 
15236: The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
15237: narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate
15238: endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
15239: rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
15240: After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into
15241: what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random
15242: whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was
15243: cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in
15244: the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his
15245: head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad
15246: flukes close by.
15247: 
15248: Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
15249: resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
15250: clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
15251: onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;
15252: but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
15253: whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask
15254: had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of
15255: which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at
15256: hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both
15257: to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,
15258: should the boats of any other ship draw near.
15259: 
15260: The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
15261: saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the
15262: drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for
15263: the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some
15264: other craft than the Pequod.
15265: 
15266: 
15267: CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.
15268: 
15269: The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
15270: Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
15271: vast aggregations.
15272: 
15273: Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
15274: have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
15275: occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
15276: Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those
15277: composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young
15278: vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
15279: 
15280: In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
15281: male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
15282: his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
15283: ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
15284: over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
15285: endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his
15286: concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
15287: leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
15288: than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
15289: comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
15290: yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
15291: whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.
15292: 
15293: It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
15294: ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
15295: leisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the
15296: full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,
15297: perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating
15298: summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have
15299: lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for
15300: the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so
15301: evade the other excessive temperature of the year.
15302: 
15303: When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
15304: suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
15305: interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
15306: coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
15307: ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
15308: him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are
15309: to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do
15310: what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of
15311: his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often
15312: cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with
15313: the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They
15314: fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and
15315: so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their
15316: antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these
15317: encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some
15318: instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.
15319: 
15320: But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
15321: the first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch
15322: that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
15323: revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,
15324: like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
15325: Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
15326: chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish
15327: of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the
15328: sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
15329: take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For
15330: like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my
15331: Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;
15332: and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all
15333: over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as
15334: the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as
15335: reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude
15336: overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the
15337: love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,
15338: admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to
15339: an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians
15340: and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from
15341: his amorous errors.
15342: 
15343: Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is
15344: the lord and master of that school technically known as the
15345: schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however
15346: admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then
15347: go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.
15348: His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the
15349: name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the
15350: man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read
15351: the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
15352: country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and
15353: what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of
15354: his pupils.
15355: 
15356: The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
15357: betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
15358: Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is
15359: called—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,
15360: he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to
15361: wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
15362: she keeps so many moody secrets.
15363: 
15364: The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
15365: mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while
15366: those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
15367: forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
15368: of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
15369: excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
15370: and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
15371: 
15372: The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a
15373: mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
15374: tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
15375: prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
15376: lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,
15377: and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about
15378: in quest of settlements, that is, harems.
15379: 
15380: Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
15381: still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a
15382: Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a
15383: member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
15384: every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
15385: themselves to fall a prey.
15386: 
15387: 
15388: CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
15389: 
15390: The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
15391: necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
15392: fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
15393: 
15394: It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
15395: a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
15396: and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised
15397: many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For
15398: example,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the
15399: body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
15400: drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
15401: calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the
15402: most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the
15403: fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
15404: undisputed law applicable to all cases.
15405: 
15406: Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
15407: enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in
15408: A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
15409: law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and
15410: lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
15411: comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the
15412: Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s
15413: Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,
15414: or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.
15415: 
15416: I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
15417: 
15418: II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
15419: 
15420: But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
15421: brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
15422: expound it.
15423: 
15424: First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
15425: when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at
15426: all controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a
15427: nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
15428: same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
15429: other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
15430: plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well
15431: as their intention so to do.
15432: 
15433: These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
15434: themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
15435: Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
15436: honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
15437: it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
15438: possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
15439: others are by no means so scrupulous.
15440: 
15441: Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
15442: in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
15443: a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
15444: succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
15445: their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
15446: itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up
15447: with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it
15448: before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were
15449: remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’
15450: teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had
15451: done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had
15452: remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore
15453: the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,
15454: line, harpoons, and boat.
15455: 
15456: Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
15457: judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
15458: illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
15459: wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s
15460: viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
15461: the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
15462: recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then
15463: supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
15464: harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
15465: the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
15466: her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
15467: therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
15468: became that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever
15469: harpoon might have been found sticking in her.
15470: 
15471: Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the
15472: whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
15473: 
15474: These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
15475: learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he
15476: awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to
15477: save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,
15478: harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because
15479: it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons
15480: and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)
15481: acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards
15482: took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took
15483: the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.
15484: 
15485: A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
15486: possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the
15487: matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
15488: previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in
15489: the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,
15490: I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
15491: jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of
15492: sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,
15493: has but two props to stand on.
15494: 
15495: Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:
15496: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
15497: possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
15498: Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession
15499: is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s
15500: last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble
15501: mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?
15502: What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor
15503: Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from
15504: starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the
15505: Archbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread
15506: and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure
15507: of heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular
15508: £100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary
15509: towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,
15510: John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic
15511: lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all
15512: these, is not Possession the whole of the law?
15513: 
15514: But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
15515: kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
15516: internationally and universally applicable.
15517: 
15518: What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
15519: Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
15520: mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What
15521: India to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All
15522: Loose-Fish.
15523: 
15524: What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
15525: Loose-Fish? What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is
15526: the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the
15527: ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but
15528: Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what
15529: are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?
15530: 
15531: 
15532: CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.
15533: 
15534: “De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”
15535: _Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._
15536: 
15537: Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
15538: context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
15539: that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
15540: and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division
15541: which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no
15542: intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to
15543: this day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a
15544: strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is
15545: here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle
15546: that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate
15547: car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first
15548: place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is
15549: still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
15550: happened within the last two years.
15551: 
15552: It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
15553: of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
15554: beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
15555: the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the
15556: jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
15557: Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal
15558: emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment
15559: his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.
15560: Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
15561: perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
15562: them.
15563: 
15564: Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
15565: trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
15566: fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the
15567: precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
15568: wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
15569: respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
15570: charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
15571: laying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my
15572: masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this
15573: the poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly
15574: English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
15575: heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
15576: stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
15577: hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At
15578: length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made
15579: bold to speak,
15580: 
15581: “Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”
15582: 
15583: “The Duke.”
15584: 
15585: “But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”
15586: 
15587: “It is his.”
15588: 
15589: “We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
15590: that to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our
15591: pains but our blisters?”
15592: 
15593: “It is his.”
15594: 
15595: “Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
15596: getting a livelihood?”
15597: 
15598: “It is his.”
15599: 
15600: “I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
15601: this whale.”
15602: 
15603: “It is his.”
15604: 
15605: “Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
15606: 
15607: “It is his.”
15608: 
15609: In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
15610: Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
15611: lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
15612: deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
15613: of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to
15614: take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To
15615: which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
15616: that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
15617: obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend
15618: gentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this
15619: the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three
15620: kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?
15621: 
15622: It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke
15623: to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs
15624: inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested
15625: with that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon
15626: gives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs
15627: to the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the
15628: soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
15629: matters.
15630: 
15631: But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
15632: for that, ye lawyers!
15633: 
15634: In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench
15635: author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,
15636: that ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this
15637: was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or
15638: Right whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is
15639: not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a
15640: sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be
15641: presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.
15642: 
15643: There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale
15644: and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
15645: nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I
15646: know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by
15647: inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
15648: way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head
15649: peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
15650: humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there
15651: seems a reason in all things, even in law.
15652: 
15653: 
15654: CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
15655: 
15656: “In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this
15657: Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,
15658: V.E._
15659: 
15660: It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
15661: we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the
15662: many noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
15663: the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell
15664: was smelt in the sea.
15665: 
15666: “I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
15667: some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
15668: would keel up before long.”
15669: 
15670: Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
15671: lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must
15672: be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours
15673: from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that
15674: circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the
15675: whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that
15676: is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an
15677: unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor
15678: such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,
15679: when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable
15680: indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to
15681: moor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;
15682: notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of
15683: a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of
15684: attar-of-rose.
15685: 
15686: Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
15687: had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of
15688: a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
15689: problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of
15690: prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
15691: almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the
15692: proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up
15693: his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
15694: whales in general.
15695: 
15696: The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
15697: recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
15698: knotted round the tail of one of these whales.
15699: 
15700: “There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the
15701: ship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes
15702: of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering
15703: their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,
15704: and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
15705: tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they
15706: will get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all
15707: know these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with
15708: our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too
15709: with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.
15710: Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a
15711: present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get
15712: from that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,
15713: not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to
15714: get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,
15715: than he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of
15716: it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,
15717: ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth
15718: trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the
15719: quarter-deck.
15720: 
15721: By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
15722: or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope
15723: of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,
15724: Stubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.
15725: Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the
15726: fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in
15727: the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for
15728: thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole
15729: terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon
15730: her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de
15731: Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this
15732: aromatic ship.
15733: 
15734: Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,
15735: yet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
15736: sufficiently explained the whole to him.
15737: 
15738: “A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will
15739: do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”
15740: 
15741: Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
15742: had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
15743: to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.
15744: 
15745: Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
15746: bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that
15747: speak English?”
15748: 
15749: “Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
15750: the chief-mate.
15751: 
15752: “Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”
15753: 
15754: “_What_ whale?”
15755: 
15756: “The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
15757: 
15758: “Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”
15759: 
15760: “Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”
15761: 
15762: Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
15763: over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
15764: hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab
15765: retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
15766: 
15767: He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
15768: chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of
15769: bag.
15770: 
15771: “What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”
15772: 
15773: “I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered
15774: the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
15775: much. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”
15776: 
15777: “Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t
15778: it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will
15779: ye, Bouton-de-Rose?”
15780: 
15781: “What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,
15782: flying into a sudden passion.
15783: 
15784: “Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those
15785: whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do
15786: you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
15787: such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his
15788: whole carcase.”
15789: 
15790: “I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe
15791: it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
15792: come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll
15793: get out of this dirty scrape.”
15794: 
15795: “Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,
15796: and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene
15797: presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were
15798: getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked
15799: rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good
15800: humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many
15801: jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up
15802: to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch
15803: the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
15804: nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
15805: off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
15806: constantly filled their olfactories.
15807: 
15808: Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
15809: the Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
15810: fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from
15811: within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
15812: remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
15813: to the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the
15814: pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
15815: indignations at times.
15816: 
15817: Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
15818: Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
15819: expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who
15820: had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
15821: Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man
15822: had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore
15823: held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and
15824: confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
15825: for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all
15826: dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan
15827: of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,
15828: was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and
15829: as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost
15830: in him during the interview.
15831: 
15832: By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a
15833: small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with
15834: large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet
15835: vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now
15836: politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put
15837: on the aspect of interpreting between them.
15838: 
15839: “What shall I say to him first?” said he.
15840: 
15841: “Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you
15842: may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
15843: though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”
15844: 
15845: “He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
15846: captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
15847: and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
15848: blasted whale they had brought alongside.”
15849: 
15850: Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
15851: 
15852: “What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
15853: 
15854: “Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
15855: carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a
15856: whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a
15857: baboon.”
15858: 
15859: “He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
15860: is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures
15861: us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”
15862: 
15863: Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
15864: crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
15865: loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
15866: 
15867: “What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
15868: them.
15869: 
15870: “Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact,
15871: tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
15872: else.”
15873: 
15874: “He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to
15875: us.”
15876: 
15877: Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
15878: (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into
15879: his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
15880: 
15881: “He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.
15882: 
15883: “Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink
15884: with the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”
15885: 
15886: “He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;
15887: but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur
15888: had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,
15889: for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”
15890: 
15891: By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
15892: the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his
15893: boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the
15894: lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s
15895: boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb
15896: benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously
15897: slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.
15898: 
15899: Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
15900: hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while
15901: the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb
15902: quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give
15903: notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his
15904: unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an
15905: excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost
15906: have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at
15907: length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up
15908: old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew
15909: were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking
15910: as anxious as gold-hunters.
15911: 
15912: And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
15913: screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning
15914: to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,
15915: when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a
15916: faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells
15917: without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then
15918: along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.
15919: 
15920: “I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
15921: in the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”
15922: 
15923: Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
15924: something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
15925: cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with
15926: your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,
15927: good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
15928: druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
15929: lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were
15930: it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come
15931: on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.
15932: 
15933: 
15934: CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.
15935: 
15936: Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
15937: article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
15938: Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
15939: subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
15940: the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
15941: to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound
15942: for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,
15943: though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far
15944: inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.
15945: Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
15946: used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris
15947: is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely
15948: used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
15949: pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for
15950: the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.
15951: Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
15952: 
15953: Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
15954: regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
15955: sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the
15956: cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to
15957: cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
15958: three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of
15959: harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.
15960: 
15961: I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
15962: certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be
15963: sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were
15964: nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
15965: 
15966: Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
15967: found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that
15968: saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;
15969: how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise
15970: call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the
15971: best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
15972: ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is
15973: the worst.
15974: 
15975: I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
15976: cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
15977: whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
15978: might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
15979: of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
15980: aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is
15981: throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to
15982: rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this
15983: odious stigma originate?
15984: 
15985: I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
15986: Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
15987: those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea
15988: as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh
15989: blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,
15990: and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those
15991: Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,
15992: forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking
15993: into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the
15994: Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising
15995: from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a
15996: Lying-in Hospital.
15997: 
15998: I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
15999: likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
16000: times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
16001: latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
16002: work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports
16003: (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to
16004: afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried
16005: out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a
16006: collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works
16007: were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But
16008: all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a
16009: voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with
16010: oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling
16011: out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.
16012: The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a
16013: species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be
16014: recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew
16015: in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be
16016: otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high
16017: health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it
16018: is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm
16019: Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented
16020: lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the
16021: Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be
16022: to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,
16023: which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?
16024: 
16025: 
16026: CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
16027: 
16028: It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
16029: significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew;
16030: an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes
16031: madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
16032: prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
16033: 
16034: Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
16035: Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
16036: to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general
16037: thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising
16038: the boats’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,
16039: or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a
16040: ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by
16041: nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;
16042: ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so
16043: gloomy-jolly.
16044: 
16045: In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and
16046: a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven
16047: in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull
16048: and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at
16049: bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness
16050: peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and
16051: festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,
16052: the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five
16053: Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that
16054: this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;
16055: behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved
16056: life, and all life’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking
16057: business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
16058: most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,
16059: what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be
16060: luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him
16061: off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland
16062: County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on
16063: the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned
16064: the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the
16065: clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
16066: pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
16067: jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
16068: lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,
16069: but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,
16070: infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest
16071: symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from
16072: the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
16073: 
16074: It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
16075: chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
16076: and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
16077: 
16078: The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
16079: but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
16080: therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
16081: him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
16082: to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
16083: 
16084: Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
16085: the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
16086: happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The
16087: involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
16088: hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
16089: line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as
16090: to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That
16091: instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
16092: straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of
16093: the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
16094: several turns around his chest and neck.
16095: 
16096: Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He
16097: hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he
16098: suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
16099: exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face
16100: plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than
16101: half a minute, this entire thing happened.
16102: 
16103: “Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
16104: saved.
16105: 
16106: So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
16107: yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these
16108: irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,
16109: but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,
16110: unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
16111: jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the
16112: soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your
16113: true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from
16114: the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if
16115: he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be
16116: leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly
16117: dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to
16118: the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind
16119: that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would
16120: sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in
16121: mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,
16122: that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
16123: which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
16124: 
16125: But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
16126: under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this
16127: time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started
16128: to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s
16129: trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,
16130: bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly
16131: stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin
16132: hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s
16133: ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when
16134: he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;
16135: and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless
16136: ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor
16137: Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely
16138: castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.
16139: 
16140: Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
16141: practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
16142: lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
16143: middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,
16144: how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely
16145: they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
16146: 
16147: But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;
16148: he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,
16149: and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip
16150: very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations
16151: towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always
16152: manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances
16153: not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
16154: called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
16155: military navies and armies.
16156: 
16157: But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
16158: spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
16159: Stubb’s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
16160: upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him
16161: miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
16162: but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,
16163: at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
16164: up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.
16165: Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
16166: the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
16167: and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the
16168: joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,
16169: God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters
16170: heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the
16171: loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So
16172: man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
16173: man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
16174: absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
16175: indifferent as his God.
16176: 
16177: For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
16178: fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
16179: like abandonment befell myself.
16180: 
16181: 
16182: CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.
16183: 
16184: That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
16185: Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
16186: previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
16187: the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
16188: 
16189: While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
16190: dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and
16191: when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
16192: ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
16193: 
16194: It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
16195: several others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I
16196: found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
16197: in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
16198: into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this
16199: sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!
16200: such a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it
16201: for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it
16202: were, to serpentine and spiralise.
16203: 
16204: As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
16205: exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
16206: indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands
16207: among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost
16208: within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all
16209: their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
16210: uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring
16211: violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky
16212: meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible
16213: sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
16214: the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in
16215: allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely
16216: free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
16217: whatsoever.
16218: 
16219: Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
16220: till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a
16221: strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly
16222: squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the
16223: gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
16224: feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually
16225: squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as
16226: much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
16227: any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;
16228: let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into
16229: each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
16230: sperm of kindness.
16231: 
16232: Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since
16233: by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all
16234: cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of
16235: attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the
16236: fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the
16237: fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready
16238: to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I
16239: saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of
16240: spermaceti.
16241: 
16242: Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
16243: akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
16244: try-works.
16245: 
16246: First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
16247: part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It
16248: is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some
16249: oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut
16250: into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like
16251: blocks of Berkshire marble.
16252: 
16253: Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
16254: whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
16255: often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
16256: a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
16257: imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
16258: snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
16259: purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,
16260: it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
16261: stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should
16262: conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have
16263: tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the
16264: venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
16265: unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.
16266: 
16267: There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
16268: the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
16269: adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation
16270: original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.
16271: It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the
16272: tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I
16273: hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,
16274: coalescing.
16275: 
16276: Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
16277: sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
16278: dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
16279: Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
16280: inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
16281: 
16282: Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s
16283: vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s
16284: nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
16285: part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the
16286: rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along
16287: the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
16288: blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.
16289: 
16290: But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
16291: once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
16292: inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for
16293: the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the
16294: proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a
16295: scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by
16296: a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They
16297: generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The
16298: whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same
16299: name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the
16300: gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from
16301: slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the
16302: spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into
16303: the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the
16304: spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes
16305: irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of
16306: his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much
16307: astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.
16308: 
16309: 
16310: CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.
16311: 
16312: Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
16313: post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
16314: windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
16315: curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
16316: there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
16317: cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
16318: jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
16319: surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than
16320: a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
16321: jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it
16322: is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that
16323: found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for
16324: worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the
16325: idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly
16326: set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.
16327: 
16328: Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
16329: assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners
16330: call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a
16331: grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the
16332: forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,
16333: as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt
16334: inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as
16335: almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in
16336: the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some
16337: three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two
16338: slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself
16339: bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full
16340: canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this
16341: investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the
16342: peculiar functions of his office.
16343: 
16344: That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
16345: pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
16346: planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath
16347: it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt
16348: orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;
16349: intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a
16350: lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
16351: 
16352: *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates
16353: to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
16354: thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
16355: boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably
16356: increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.
16357: 
16358: 
16359: CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.
16360: 
16361: Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
16362: distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the
16363: most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
16364: completed ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
16365: transported to her planks.
16366: 
16367: The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
16368: roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
16369: fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
16370: mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The
16371: foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
16372: secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
16373: sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased
16374: with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened
16375: hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
16376: number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they
16377: are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone
16378: and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the
16379: night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
16380: themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one
16381: man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are
16382: carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound
16383: mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,
16384: with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first
16385: indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies
16386: gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from
16387: any point in precisely the same time.
16388: 
16389: Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
16390: masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
16391: the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted
16392: with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented
16393: from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
16394: extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
16395: inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
16396: fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
16397: from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.
16398: 
16399: It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were
16400: first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee
16401: the business.
16402: 
16403: “All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
16404: works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting
16405: his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said
16406: that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed
16407: for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of
16408: quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,
16409: the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still
16410: contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed
16411: the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming
16412: misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by
16413: his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is
16414: horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you
16415: must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor
16416: about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells
16417: like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the
16418: pit.
16419: 
16420: By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
16421: carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
16422: darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
16423: flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
16424: illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
16425: fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
16426: some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
16427: bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
16428: sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and
16429: folded them in conflagrations.
16430: 
16431: The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
16432: hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of
16433: the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge
16434: pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding
16435: pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,
16436: curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled
16437: away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of
16438: the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.
16439: Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden
16440: hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the
16441: watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the
16442: fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny
16443: features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,
16444: and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
16445: strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they
16446: narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror
16447: told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards
16448: out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their
16449: front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged
16450: forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the
16451: ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
16452: and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
16453: champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
16454: all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
16455: with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
16456: darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s
16457: soul.
16458: 
16459: So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
16460: guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that
16461: interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the
16462: madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend
16463: shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at
16464: last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to
16465: that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a
16466: midnight helm.
16467: 
16468: But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
16469: thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
16470: horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller
16471: smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of
16472: sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were
16473: open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and
16474: mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all
16475: this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed
16476: but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle
16477: lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and
16478: then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,
16479: that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to
16480: any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered
16481: feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the
16482: tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in
16483: some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?
16484: thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was
16485: fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In
16486: an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying
16487: up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how
16488: grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and
16489: the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
16490: 
16491: Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
16492: hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first
16493: hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
16494: redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,
16495: the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking
16496: flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the
16497: glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!
16498: 
16499: Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s
16500: accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
16501: deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,
16502: which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
16503: earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
16504: in him, that mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With
16505: books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the
16506: truest of all books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
16507: steel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold
16508: of unchristian Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and
16509: jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of
16510: operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils
16511: all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais
16512: as passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit
16513: down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
16514: wondrous Solomon.
16515: 
16516: But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of
16517: understanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even while living) “in the
16518: congregation of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it
16519: invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom
16520: that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a
16521: Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest
16522: gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny
16523: spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is
16524: in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle
16525: is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.
16526: 
16527: 
16528: CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.
16529: 
16530: Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s
16531: forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
16532: moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
16533: illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay
16534: in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
16535: score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.
16536: 
16537: In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
16538: queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
16539: darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he
16540: seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an
16541: Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night
16542: the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination.
16543: 
16544: See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
16545: lamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at
16546: the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He
16547: burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
16548: unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
16549: contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
16550: goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and
16551: genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
16552: supper of game.
16553: 
16554: 
16555: CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
16556: 
16557: Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
16558: descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
16559: and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
16560: alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the
16561: headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his
16562: great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
16563: due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and
16564: Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the
16565: fire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of
16566: the description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding
16567: of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the
16568: hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,
16569: sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to
16570: rise and blow.
16571: 
16572: While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
16573: six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
16574: this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
16575: round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
16576: across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
16577: man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,
16578: rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,
16579: every sailor is a cooper.
16580: 
16581: At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
16582: great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
16583: and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the
16584: hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
16585: 
16586: In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
16587: incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream
16588: with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
16589: masses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
16590: about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted
16591: all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the
16592: entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din
16593: is deafening.
16594: 
16595: But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
16596: self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,
16597: you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
16598: most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil
16599: possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the
16600: decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of
16601: oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a
16602: potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back
16603: of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly
16604: exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with
16605: buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot
16606: is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which
16607: have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The
16608: great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely
16609: hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in
16610: unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of
16611: almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
16612: is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
16613: ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
16614: immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from
16615: out the daintiest Holland.
16616: 
16617: Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
16618: humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
16619: propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not
16620: to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to
16621: such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
16622: of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and
16623: bring us napkins!
16624: 
16625: But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent
16626: on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil
16627: the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
16628: somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest
16629: uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through
16630: for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their
16631: wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to
16632: carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,
16633: yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the
16634: combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;
16635: when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves
16636: to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the
16637: time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,
16638: are startled by the cry of “There she blows!” and away they fly to
16639: fight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my
16640: friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we
16641: mortals by long toilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its
16642: small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed
16643: ourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean
16644: tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when—_There she
16645: blows!_—the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other
16646: world, and go through young life’s old routine again.
16647: 
16648: Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
16649: thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
16650: thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught
16651: thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!
16652: 
16653: 
16654: CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.
16655: 
16656: Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
16657: taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
16658: the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
16659: added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
16660: he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
16661: eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the
16662: binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the
16663: compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of
16664: his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the
16665: mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted
16666: gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only
16667: dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.
16668: 
16669: But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
16670: attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
16671: though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
16672: some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
16673: certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
16674: worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell
16675: by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass
16676: in the Milky Way.
16677: 
16678: Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
16679: the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,
16680: the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst
16681: all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,
16682: yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its
16683: Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour
16684: passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with
16685: thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
16686: every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it
16687: was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however
16688: wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as
16689: the white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary
16690: watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he
16691: would ever live to spend it.
16692: 
16693: Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun
16694: and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s
16695: disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
16696: are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
16697: almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by
16698: passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
16699: 
16700: It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
16701: example of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,
16702: REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country
16703: planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and
16704: named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the
16705: unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the
16706: likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;
16707: on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of
16708: the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual
16709: cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at
16710: Libra.
16711: 
16712: Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
16713: pausing.
16714: 
16715: “There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
16716: all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as
16717: Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
16718: courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
16719: are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
16720: which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but
16721: mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for
16722: those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks
16723: now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the
16724: sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out
16725: of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born
16726: in throes, ’tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So
16727: be it, then! Here’s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
16728: 
16729: “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must
16730: have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to
16731: himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read
16732: Belshazzar’s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.
16733: He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
16734: heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint
16735: earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over
16736: all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a
16737: hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
16738: but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to
16739: cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we
16740: would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!
16741: This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will
16742: quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
16743: 
16744: “There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s
16745: been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
16746: faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
16747: And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on
16748: Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere
16749: spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as
16750: queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
16751: of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your
16752: doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold
16753: moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What
16754: then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing
16755: wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and
16756: wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the
16757: zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and
16758: as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try
16759: my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
16760: Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. Signs and
16761: wonders; and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they
16762: are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and
16763: Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels
16764: among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the threshold
16765: between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;
16766: the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll do to give us the
16767: bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That’s my
16768: small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s
16769: navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if
16770: there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!
16771: There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it!
16772: Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round
16773: chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come,
16774: Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets
16775: us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,
16776: or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!
16777: comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,
16778: Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and
16779: surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that’s
16780: our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
16781: Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
16782: are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the
16783: Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang
16784: come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing
16785: himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the
16786: battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,
16787: and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours
16788: out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the
16789: Fishes, we sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the
16790: sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and
16791: hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and
16792: so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu,
16793: Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the
16794: try-works, now, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s
16795: before it; he’ll out with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”
16796: 
16797: “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises
16798: a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this
16799: staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at
16800: two cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t
16801: smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine
16802: hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”
16803: 
16804: “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
16805: foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
16806: wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old
16807: hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.
16808: He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other
16809: side of the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and
16810: now he’s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s muttering—voice
16811: like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
16812: 
16813: “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
16814: the sun stands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs, and know
16815: their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch
16816: in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe
16817: sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what’s the
16818: horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and
16819: devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”
16820: 
16821: “There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
16822: one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all
16823: tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
16824: Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
16825: thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
16826: suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in the back country.
16827: And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I
16828: guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know what to make
16829: of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king’s
16830: trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail
16831: coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.
16832: What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the
16833: sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper,
16834: depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would
16835: he had died, or I; he’s half horrible to me. He too has been watching
16836: all of these interpreters—myself included—and look now, he comes to
16837: read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him.
16838: Hark!”
16839: 
16840: “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
16841: 
16842: “Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind,
16843: poor fellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”
16844: 
16845: “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
16846: 
16847: “Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
16848: 
16849: “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
16850: 
16851: “Well, that’s funny.”
16852: 
16853: “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a
16854: crow, especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!
16855: caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow? There
16856: he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more
16857: poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.”
16858: 
16859: “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang
16860: myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can stand
16861: the rest, for they have plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for my
16862: sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
16863: 
16864: “Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire
16865: to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the consequence?
16866: Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught’s
16867: nailed to the mast it’s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old
16868: Ahab! the White Whale; he’ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father,
16869: in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver
16870: ring grown over in it; some old darkey’s wedding ring. How did it get
16871: there? And so they’ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish
16872: up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters
16873: for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the
16874: green miser’ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes ’mong the worlds
16875: blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey,
16876: hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!”
16877: 
16878: 
16879: CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
16880: 
16881: The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
16882: 
16883: “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
16884: 
16885: So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
16886: bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
16887: standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to
16888: the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s
16889: bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
16890: sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round
16891: him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket
16892: streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.
16893: 
16894: “Hast seen the White Whale?”
16895: 
16896: “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
16897: he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
16898: head like a mallet.
16899: 
16900: “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
16901: him—“Stand by to lower!”
16902: 
16903: In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
16904: crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
16905: stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the
16906: excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his
16907: leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
16908: own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical
16909: contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and
16910: shipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very
16911: easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,
16912: like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;
16913: for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,
16914: and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,
16915: deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether
16916: unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly
16917: reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain
16918: changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
16919: 
16920: It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
16921: circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
16922: luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
16923: in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
16924: two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
16925: perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
16926: pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
16927: to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
16928: use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
16929: because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
16930: cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing
16931: over the cutting-tackle.”
16932: 
16933: As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
16934: previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
16935: curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.
16936: This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
16937: slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting
16938: in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then
16939: giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to
16940: hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running
16941: parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high
16942: bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm
16943: frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,
16944: putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two
16945: sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let
16946: us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can
16947: shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see
16948: the White Whale?—how long ago?”
16949: 
16950: “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
16951: the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
16952: telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
16953: 
16954: “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from
16955: the capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.
16956: 
16957: “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
16958: 
16959: “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
16960: 
16961: “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,”
16962: began the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
16963: Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
16964: fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
16965: milling and milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish,
16966: by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
16967: from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white
16968: head and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”
16969: 
16970: “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
16971: breath.
16972: 
16973: “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
16974: 
16975: “Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
16976: 
16977: “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,
16978: this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all
16979: afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
16980: 
16981: “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know
16982: him.”
16983: 
16984: “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not
16985: know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
16986: somehow; but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled
16987: on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other
16988: whale’s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters
16989: stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I
16990: ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the
16991: boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would
16992: get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a
16993: devil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I
16994: say, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the
16995: way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped
16996: into Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with
16997: mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
16998: great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls
16999: alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes
17000: out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail
17001: looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
17002: steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,
17003: with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after
17004: the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima
17005: tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
17006: flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
17007: all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I
17008: seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung
17009: to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at
17010: the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down
17011: like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near
17012: me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,
17013: caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was
17014: thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb
17015: ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my
17016: arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there
17017: will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:
17018: Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the
17019: yarn.”
17020: 
17021: The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
17022: the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
17023: his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but
17024: sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
17025: patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between
17026: a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
17027: occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
17028: crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab,
17029: he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.
17030: 
17031: “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my
17032: advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
17033: 
17034: “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed
17035: captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
17036: 
17037: “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
17038: hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat
17039: up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
17040: 
17041: “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
17042: altering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till
17043: he couldn’t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half
17044: seas over, about three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up
17045: with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,
17046: and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh
17047: out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave
17048: ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other
17049: man.”
17050: 
17051: “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the
17052: imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to
17053: be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But
17054: I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that
17055: is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total
17056: abstinence man; I never drink—”
17057: 
17058: “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to
17059: him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with
17060: the arm story.”
17061: 
17062: “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,
17063: sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my
17064: best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;
17065: the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;
17066: more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead
17067: line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it
17068: came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
17069: against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the
17070: captain’s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had
17071: that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s brains out
17072: with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical
17073: passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and
17074: brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
17075: but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
17076: having been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that
17077: came here; he knows.”
17078: 
17079: “No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with
17080: it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another
17081: Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
17082: pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
17083: 
17084: “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
17085: impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
17086: 
17087: “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
17088: didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
17089: didn’t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
17090: till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about
17091: Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
17092: 
17093: “Did’st thou cross his wake again?”
17094: 
17095: “Twice.”
17096: 
17097: “But could not fasten?”
17098: 
17099: “Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without
17100: this other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he
17101: swallows.”
17102: 
17103: “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to
17104: get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically
17105: bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the
17106: digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
17107: Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
17108: even a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the
17109: White Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to
17110: swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But
17111: sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of
17112: mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a
17113: time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a
17114: twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in
17115: small tacks, d’ye see. No possible way for him to digest that
17116: jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.
17117: Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind
17118: to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial
17119: to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale
17120: have another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”
17121: 
17122: “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the
17123: arm he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to
17124: another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once,
17125: and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I
17126: know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark
17127: ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the
17128: ivory leg.
17129: 
17130: “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let
17131: alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a
17132: magnet! How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”
17133: 
17134: “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly
17135: walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s
17136: blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes
17137: these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing
17138: near to Ahab’s arm.
17139: 
17140: “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat!
17141: Which way heading?”
17142: 
17143: “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
17144: “What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain
17145: crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
17146: 
17147: But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
17148: take the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
17149: towards him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.
17150: 
17151: In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men
17152: were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.
17153: With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
17154: Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
17155: 
17156: 
17157: CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.
17158: 
17159: Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
17160: hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
17161: merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
17162: Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not
17163: far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point
17164: of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord
17165: 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
17166: fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out
17167: the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;
17168: though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant
17169: Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets
17170: pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not
17171: elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were
17172: the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm
17173: Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the
17174: whole globe who so harpooned him.
17175: 
17176: In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
17177: and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
17178: Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
17179: sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
17180: and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,
17181: the Amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships, English and
17182: American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were
17183: thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
17184: house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their
17185: mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I
17186: think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the
17187: sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South
17188: Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling
17189: voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this
17190: is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship
17191: of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.
17192: That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and
17193: it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became
17194: generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a
17195: Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
17196: 
17197: All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
17198: the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago
17199: have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.
17200: 
17201: The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
17202: sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
17203: somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
17204: forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every
17205: soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine
17206: gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
17207: ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that
17208: ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
17209: lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
17210: at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s
17211: squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were
17212: called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
17213: other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
17214: jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the
17215: howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts
17216: did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that
17217: we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting
17218: down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to
17219: my taste.
17220: 
17221: The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was
17222: bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
17223: certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
17224: symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that
17225: you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were
17226: swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their
17227: pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be
17228: helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread
17229: contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very
17230: light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you
17231: ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the
17232: dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment
17233: boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of
17234: good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and
17235: capital from boot heels to hat-band.
17236: 
17237: But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
17238: English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable
17239: ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
17240: joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I
17241: will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is
17242: matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of
17243: historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.
17244: 
17245: The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
17246: Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
17247: in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching
17248: plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English
17249: merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,
17250: in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and
17251: natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some
17252: special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further
17253: elucidated.
17254: 
17255: During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
17256: ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew
17257: must be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I
17258: concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
17259: cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was
17260: reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
17261: “Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,
17262: professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus
17263: and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a
17264: box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as
17265: he spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The
17266: Cooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low
17267: Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other
17268: subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.
17269: And in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a
17270: long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180
17271: sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,
17272: I transcribe the following:
17273: 
17274: 400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
17275: fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins
17276: of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
17277: (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
17278: beer.
17279: 
17280: Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
17281: the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
17282: pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
17283: 
17284: At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
17285: beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
17286: incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
17287: application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my
17288: own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by
17289: every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen
17290: whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and
17291: Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their
17292: naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the
17293: nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
17294: in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux
17295: country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of
17296: train oil.
17297: 
17298: The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
17299: polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
17300: climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
17301: including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not
17302: much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their
17303: fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I
17304: say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’
17305: allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.
17306: Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
17307: fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a
17308: boat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
17309: somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But
17310: this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with
17311: the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would
17312: be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
17313: boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
17314: 
17315: But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of
17316: two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
17317: whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
17318: cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
17319: world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the
17320: decanter.
17321: 
17322: 
17323: CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.
17324: 
17325: Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
17326: dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
17327: upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
17328: sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
17329: further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,
17330: and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
17331: bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his
17332: unconditional skeleton.
17333: 
17334: But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
17335: fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
17336: whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
17337: on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a
17338: specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a
17339: full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a
17340: roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,
17341: Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
17342: the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,
17343: ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of
17344: leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and
17345: cheeseries in his bowels.
17346: 
17347: I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
17348: beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed
17349: with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
17350: to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
17351: poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
17352: heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my
17353: boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
17354: contents of that young cub?
17355: 
17356: And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
17357: gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted
17358: to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.
17359: For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey
17360: of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with
17361: the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side
17362: glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
17363: capital.
17364: 
17365: Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
17366: with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
17367: together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
17368: people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
17369: chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and
17370: all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
17371: wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.
17372: 
17373: Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
17374: unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
17375: head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
17376: seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of
17377: its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
17378: then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where
17379: a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
17380: 
17381: The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with
17382: Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
17383: kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
17384: sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the
17385: terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung
17386: sword that so affrighted Damocles.
17387: 
17388: It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;
17389: the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
17390: industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous
17391: carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
17392: woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their
17393: laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
17394: message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the
17395: lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
17396: the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one
17397: word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all
17398: these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single
17399: word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the
17400: loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,
17401: he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal
17402: voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;
17403: and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak
17404: through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken
17405: words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words
17406: are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened
17407: casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be
17408: heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world’s loom, thy
17409: subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.
17410: 
17411: Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
17412: great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,
17413: as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
17414: him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
17415: with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but
17416: himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim
17417: god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
17418: 
17419: Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
17420: skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
17421: jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an
17422: object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests
17423: should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
17424: before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and
17425: with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many
17426: winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and
17427: following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no
17428: living thing within; naught was there but bones.
17429: 
17430: Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the
17431: skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me
17432: taking the altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st
17433: thou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long
17434: do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,
17435: concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with
17436: their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,
17437: I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.
17438: 
17439: These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
17440: recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
17441: measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can
17442: refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell
17443: me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
17444: they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,
17445: I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they
17446: have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a
17447: Greenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in
17448: Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford
17449: Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of
17450: moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend
17451: King Tranquo’s.
17452: 
17453: In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
17454: belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
17455: grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
17456: Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir
17457: Clifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great
17458: chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
17459: cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon
17460: his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
17461: shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
17462: keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep
17463: at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the
17464: echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled
17465: view from his forehead.
17466: 
17467: The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
17468: verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
17469: wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
17470: such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished
17471: the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then
17472: composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did not
17473: trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
17474: enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.
17475: 
17476: 
17477: CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.
17478: 
17479: In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
17480: statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
17481: we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
17482: 
17483: According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
17484: upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
17485: Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
17486: calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
17487: eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
17488: feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
17489: ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
17490: considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
17491: thousand one hundred inhabitants.
17492: 
17493: Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
17494: this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?
17495: 
17496: Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
17497: jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
17498: simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
17499: unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a
17500: proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
17501: most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it
17502: in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
17503: your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
17504: of the general structure we are about to view.
17505: 
17506: In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
17507: feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
17508: been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
17509: fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two
17510: feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty
17511: feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less
17512: than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs
17513: which once enclosed his vitals.
17514: 
17515: To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
17516: extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
17517: the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
17518: twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
17519: for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.
17520: 
17521: The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was
17522: nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
17523: successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
17524: of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From
17525: that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
17526: spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore
17527: a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most
17528: arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
17529: footpath bridges over small streams.
17530: 
17531: In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
17532: circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
17533: the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of
17534: the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the
17535: fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of
17536: the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least
17537: sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more
17538: than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion
17539: of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I
17540: now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with
17541: tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for
17542: the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of
17543: the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
17544: 
17545: How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try
17546: to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his
17547: dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in
17548: the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his
17549: angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully
17550: invested whale be truly and livingly found out.
17551: 
17552: But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
17553: crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
17554: it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.
17555: 
17556: There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not
17557: locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a
17558: Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a
17559: middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
17560: more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
17561: tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
17562: billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
17563: had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,
17564: who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the
17565: spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into
17566: simple child’s play.
17567: 
17568: 
17569: CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.
17570: 
17571: From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
17572: to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
17573: compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
17574: folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and
17575: the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic
17576: involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables
17577: and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
17578: line-of-battle-ship.
17579: 
17580: Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
17581: approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
17582: overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
17583: out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him
17584: in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now
17585: remains to magnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and
17586: antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
17587: Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed
17588: unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case
17589: is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
17590: words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been
17591: convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have
17592: invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased
17593: for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal
17594: bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
17595: like me.
17596: 
17597: One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
17598: though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of
17599: this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
17600: capitals. Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an
17601: inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my
17602: thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
17603: outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
17604: circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
17605: mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas
17606: of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding
17607: its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and
17608: liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you
17609: must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be
17610: written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.
17611: 
17612: Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
17613: credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I
17614: have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and
17615: wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by
17616: way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the
17617: earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now
17618: almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are
17619: called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate
17620: intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose
17621: remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil
17622: Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the
17623: last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them
17624: precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
17625: sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking
17626: rank as Cetacean fossils.
17627: 
17628: Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
17629: and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
17630: been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,
17631: in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
17632: Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
17633: year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street
17634: opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones
17635: disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s
17636: time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some
17637: utterly unknown Leviathanic species.
17638: 
17639: But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
17640: complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
17641: on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken
17642: credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
17643: fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
17644: bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of
17645: it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned
17646: out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed
17647: species. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again
17648: repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but
17649: little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen
17650: rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
17651: London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most
17652: extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted
17653: out of existence.
17654: 
17655: When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
17656: jaws, ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to
17657: the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on
17658: the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
17659: Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to
17660: that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for
17661: time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I
17662: obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
17663: wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and
17664: in all the 25,000 miles of this world’s circumference, not an
17665: inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world
17666: was the whale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
17667: present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree
17668: like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s.
17669: Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I
17670: am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the
17671: unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,
17672: must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
17673: 
17674: But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
17675: stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
17676: ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
17677: for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
17678: print of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some
17679: fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
17680: sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,
17681: and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe
17682: of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was
17683: there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was
17684: cradled.
17685: 
17686: Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
17687: of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
17688: the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
17689: 
17690: “Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
17691: of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
17692: oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine,
17693: that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can
17694: pass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that
17695: on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into
17696: the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon ’em. They keep a
17697: Whale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the
17698: Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which
17699: cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John
17700: Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their
17701: Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from
17702: this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas
17703: was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.”
17704: 
17705: In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
17706: Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.
17707: 
17708: 
17709: CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?
17710: 
17711: Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
17712: the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
17713: in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the
17714: original bulk of his sires.
17715: 
17716: But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
17717: present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
17718: found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
17719: prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
17720: belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
17721: ones.
17722: 
17723: Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
17724: Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
17725: seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
17726: that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a
17727: large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority,
17728: that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the
17729: time of capture.
17730: 
17731: But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
17732: advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may
17733: it not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?
17734: 
17735: Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
17736: such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For
17737: Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
17738: Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope
17739: Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and
17740: Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy
17741: of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or
17742: Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three
17743: hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his
17744: elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page
17745: 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and
17746: twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.
17747: 
17748: But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is
17749: as big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny
17750: is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
17751: Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies
17752: that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not
17753: measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;
17754: and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest
17755: Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they
17756: are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize
17757: cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the
17758: fattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not
17759: admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.
17760: 
17761: But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
17762: recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient
17763: look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even
17764: through Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
17765: lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along
17766: all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long
17767: endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not
17768: at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the
17769: last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final
17770: puff.
17771: 
17772: Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
17773: which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the
17774: prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
17775: scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
17776: river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar
17777: an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem
17778: furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy
17779: extinction.
17780: 
17781: But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a
17782: period ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois
17783: exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
17784: not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
17785: cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
17786: different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious
17787: an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales
17788: for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank
17789: God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the
17790: days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,
17791: when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness
17792: and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of
17793: months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
17794: not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need
17795: were, could be statistically stated.
17796: 
17797: Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
17798: gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former
17799: years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
17800: small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
17801: consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
17802: remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
17803: influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
17804: caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,
17805: and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but
17806: widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally
17807: fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone
17808: whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with
17809: them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being
17810: driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened
17811: with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been
17812: very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
17813: 
17814: Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
17815: firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
17816: impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty
17817: Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas
17818: and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort
17819: to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers
17820: and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed
17821: circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
17822: 
17823: But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
17824: cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
17825: positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
17826: But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
17827: 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the
17828: Americans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this
17829: circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this
17830: matter.
17831: 
17832: Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
17833: of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
17834: Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
17835: King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are
17836: numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems
17837: no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted
17838: for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all
17839: the successive monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in
17840: great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since
17841: he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as
17842: all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the
17843: Isles of the sea combined.
17844: 
17845: Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
17846: whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
17847: therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
17848: must be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of,
17849: by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
17850: creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and
17851: children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this
17852: countless host to the present human population of the globe.
17853: 
17854: Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
17855: species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas
17856: before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
17857: Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he
17858: despised Noah’s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
17859: the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will
17860: still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial
17861: flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.
17862: 
17863: 
17864: CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.
17865: 
17866: The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
17867: Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to
17868: his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
17869: boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when
17870: after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
17871: vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it
17872: was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);
17873: then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and
17874: wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances
17875: lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.
17876: 
17877: And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
17878: pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
17879: condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
17880: been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he
17881: had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;
17882: by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
17883: ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise
17884: smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
17885: difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.
17886: 
17887: Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
17888: the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of
17889: a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most
17890: poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as
17891: the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,
17892: all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than
17893: equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief
17894: go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of
17895: this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that
17896: while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
17897: for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the
17898: joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal
17899: miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally
17900: progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of
17901: this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the
17902: thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities
17903: ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at
17904: bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an
17905: archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the
17906: obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
17907: miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
17908: gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
17909: cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that
17910: the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad
17911: birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the
17912: signers.
17913: 
17914: Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
17915: properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
17916: particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
17917: why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the
17918: sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
17919: Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
17920: speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
17921: Captain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
17922: adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every
17923: revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
17924: light. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.
17925: That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And
17926: not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,
17927: who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach
17928: to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it
17929: did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not
17930: entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,
17931: through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them
17932: lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it
17933: was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it
17934: transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.
17935: 
17936: But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,
17937: or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
17938: with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took
17939: plain practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.
17940: 
17941: And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
17942: delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
17943: supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which
17944: had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful
17945: selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.
17946: This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that
17947: night; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those
17948: pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was
17949: ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,
17950: to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at
17951: once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.
17952: 
17953: 
17954: CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.
17955: 
17956: Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
17957: abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
17958: from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
17959: seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
17960: But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of
17961: the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate;
17962: hence, he now comes in person on this stage.
17963: 
17964: Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
17965: to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,
17966: alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his
17967: own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk
17968: of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with
17969: wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of
17970: the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly
17971: efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually
17972: recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in
17973: uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in
17974: ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the
17975: shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new
17976: tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more
17977: directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover
17978: unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both
17979: useful and capricious.
17980: 
17981: The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
17982: was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
17983: vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
17984: except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
17985: athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
17986: 
17987: A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
17988: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
17989: straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage
17990: strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
17991: right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
17992: makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the
17993: carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars
17994: to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his
17995: big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the
17996: constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the
17997: carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out
17998: pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;
17999: but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded
18000: operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter
18001: signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.
18002: 
18003: Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
18004: and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
18005: deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But
18006: while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with
18007: such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue
18008: some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For
18009: nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal
18010: stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the
18011: surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general
18012: stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while
18013: pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,
18014: and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was
18015: this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an
18016: all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an
18017: old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked
18018: now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have
18019: served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded
18020: forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a
18021: life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had
18022: gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small
18023: outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a
18024: stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
18025: babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.
18026: You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him
18027: involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did
18028: not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he
18029: had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
18030: uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
18031: process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,
18032: must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was
18033: like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in
18034: parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little
18035: swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
18036: various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
18037: pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted
18038: to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open
18039: that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him
18040: up by the legs, and there they were.
18041: 
18042: Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
18043: was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a
18044: common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
18045: did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
18046: drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it
18047: had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
18048: unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept
18049: him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an
18050: unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his
18051: body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking
18052: all the time to keep himself awake.

18055: CHAPTER 108. Ahab and the Carpenter.
18056: 
18057: The Deck—First Night Watch.
18058: 
18059: (_Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
18060: lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is
18061: firmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,
18062: and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red
18063: flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work._)
18064: 
18065: Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,
18066: and that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
18067: shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better (_sneezes_).
18068: Halloa, this bone dust is (_sneezes_)—why it’s (_sneezes_)—yes it’s
18069: (_sneezes_)—bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an old
18070: fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
18071: don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t get it
18072: (_sneezes_). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let’s
18073: have that ferule and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them presently.
18074: Lucky now (_sneezes_) there’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle
18075: a little; but a mere shinbone—why it’s easy as making hop-poles; only I
18076: should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the
18077: time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (_sneezes_)
18078: scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs
18079: I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak water,
18080: they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored
18081: (_sneezes_) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before
18082: I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the
18083: length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s
18084: the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else, that’s
18085: certain.
18086: 
18087: AHAB (_advancing_). (_During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
18088: sneezing at times._)
18089: 
18090: Well, manmaker!
18091: 
18092: Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.
18093: Let me measure, sir.
18094: 
18095: Measured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it!
18096: There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
18097: carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
18098: 
18099: Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!
18100: 
18101: No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
18102: world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
18103: blacksmith, I mean—what’s he about?
18104: 
18105: He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
18106: 
18107: Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a
18108: fierce red flame there!
18109: 
18110: Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
18111: 
18112: Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
18113: Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
18114: blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must
18115: properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies!
18116: This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,
18117: when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel
18118: shoulder-blades; there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
18119: 
18120: Sir?
18121: 
18122: Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a
18123: desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
18124: modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to stay
18125: in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,
18126: brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let
18127: me see—shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on
18128: top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
18129: 
18130: Now, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I should like
18131: to know? Shall I keep standing here? (_aside_).
18132: 
18133: ’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No,
18134: no, no; I must have a lantern.
18135: 
18136: Ho, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
18137: 
18138: What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
18139: Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.
18140: 
18141: I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
18142: 
18143: Carpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely
18144: gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;—or would’st
18145: thou rather work in clay?
18146: 
18147: Sir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
18148: 
18149: The fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
18150: 
18151: Bone is rather dusty, sir.
18152: 
18153: Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
18154: living people’s noses.
18155: 
18156: Sir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!
18157: 
18158: Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
18159: workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for
18160: thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
18161: nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
18162: is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst
18163: thou not drive that old Adam away?
18164: 
18165: Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
18166: something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
18167: entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
18168: pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
18169: 
18170: It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
18171: was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
18172: soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to
18173: a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?
18174: 
18175: I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
18176: 
18177: Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
18178: may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
18179: thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
18180: solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t
18181: speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be
18182: now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the
18183: fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
18184: 
18185: Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over
18186: again; I think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.
18187: 
18188: Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before the
18189: leg is done?
18190: 
18191: Perhaps an hour, sir.
18192: 
18193: Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!
18194: Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
18195: blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal
18196: inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free
18197: as air; and I’m down in the whole world’s books. I am so rich, I could
18198: have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prætorians at the auction of
18199: the Roman empire (which was the world’s); and yet I owe for the flesh
18200: in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into
18201: it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.
18202: 
18203: CARPENTER (_resuming his work_).
18204: 
18205: Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
18206: he’s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
18207: he’s queer, says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it
18208: into Mr. Starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer, queer, very queer. And
18209: here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his bedfellow! has
18210: a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he’ll
18211: stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three
18212: places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was that? Oh! I
18213: don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
18214: strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like.
18215: Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade
18216: out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks
18217: you under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for
18218: life-boats. And here’s the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough!
18219: Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be
18220: because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her
18221: roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look,
18222: driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears
18223: out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there
18224: with those screws, and let’s finish it before the resurrection fellow
18225: comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as
18226: brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill ’em up again.
18227: What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed down to
18228: nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on this to-morrow; he’ll be
18229: taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate,
18230: smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file,
18231: and sand-paper, now!
18232: 
18233: 
18234: CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
18235: 
18236: According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
18237: inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
18238: sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into
18239: the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
18240: 
18241: *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
18242: is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
18243: drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
18244: intervals, is removed by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought
18245: to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
18246: withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the
18247: precious cargo.
18248: 
18249: Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
18250: the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
18251: the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a
18252: general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and
18253: another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
18254: Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new
18255: ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
18256: pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with
18257: his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his
18258: old courses again.
18259: 
18260: “Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round
18261: to it. “On deck! Begone!”
18262: 
18263: “Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.
18264: We must up Burtons and break out.”
18265: 
18266: “Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
18267: for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”
18268: 
18269: “Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
18270: good in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
18271: saving, sir.”
18272: 
18273: “So it is, so it is; if we get it.”
18274: 
18275: “I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”
18276: 
18277: “And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it
18278: leak! I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky
18279: casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far
18280: worse plight than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak;
18281: for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it,
18282: even if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not have the
18283: Burtons hoisted.”
18284: 
18285: “What will the owners say, sir?”
18286: 
18287: “Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
18288: cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck,
18289: about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But
18290: look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
18291: my conscience is in this ship’s keel.—On deck!”
18292: 
18293: “Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
18294: with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost
18295: seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward
18296: manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half
18297: distrustful of itself; “A better man than I might well pass over in
18298: thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in
18299: a happier, Captain Ahab.”
18300: 
18301: “Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
18302: deck!”
18303: 
18304: “Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing!
18305: Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?”
18306: 
18307: Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
18308: South-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
18309: exclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
18310: Captain that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”
18311: 
18312: For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
18313: you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
18314: the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and
18315: as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast
18316: outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware
18317: of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;
18318: beware of thyself, old man.”
18319: 
18320: “He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
18321: murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he said—Ahab
18322: beware of Ahab—there’s something there!” Then unconsciously using the
18323: musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
18324: cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
18325: returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
18326: 
18327: “Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the mate;
18328: then raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and
18329: close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,
18330: and break out in the main-hold.”
18331: 
18332: It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
18333: Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;
18334: or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
18335: forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
18336: in the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders
18337: were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.
18338: 
18339: 
18340: CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
18341: 
18342: Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
18343: were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it
18344: being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
18345: slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
18346: sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they
18347: go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
18348: puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone
18349: cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted
18350: placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.
18351: Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of
18352: staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the
18353: piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under
18354: foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and
18355: rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the
18356: ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was
18357: it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.
18358: 
18359: Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
18360: bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
18361: to his endless end.
18362: 
18363: Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
18364: dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
18365: higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as
18366: harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but—as
18367: we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
18368: finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all
18369: day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
18370: clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,
18371: the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
18372: 
18373: Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
18374: have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
18375: stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
18376: amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
18377: of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor
18378: pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
18379: caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after
18380: some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
18381: of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few
18382: long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
18383: frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his
18384: cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller
18385: and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but
18386: deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony
18387: to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And
18388: like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his
18389: eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe
18390: that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
18391: this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any
18392: beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
18393: wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
18394: the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
18395: with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
18396: adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek
18397: had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you
18398: saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his
18399: swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his
18400: final rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
18401: higher towards his destined heaven.
18402: 
18403: Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
18404: what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
18405: asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
18406: just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had
18407: chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
18408: war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
18409: whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
18410: and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was
18411: not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead
18412: warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated
18413: away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the
18414: stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own
18415: mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form
18416: the white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the
18417: thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
18418: sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.
18419: No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial
18420: to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
18421: were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
18422: much lee-way adown the dim ages.
18423: 
18424: Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
18425: was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might
18426: include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,
18427: which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
18428: groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
18429: was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the
18430: order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
18431: promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
18432: Queequeg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s
18433: person as he shifted the rule.
18434: 
18435: “Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island
18436: sailor.
18437: 
18438: Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
18439: reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the
18440: coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two
18441: notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his
18442: tools, and to work.
18443: 
18444: When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
18445: lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
18446: whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.
18447: 
18448: Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people
18449: on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s
18450: consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
18451: him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
18452: dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
18453: shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
18454: indulged.
18455: 
18456: Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
18457: attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
18458: drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
18459: with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,
18460: biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh
18461: water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up
18462: in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for
18463: a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that
18464: he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without
18465: moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his
18466: little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo
18467: between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed
18468: over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay
18469: Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in
18470: view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and
18471: signed to be replaced in his hammock.
18472: 
18473: But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
18474: this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took
18475: him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
18476: 
18477: “Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
18478: go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where
18479: the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little
18480: errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think
18481: he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he
18482: must be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found
18483: it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your
18484: dying march.”
18485: 
18486: “I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in
18487: violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
18488: that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
18489: wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
18490: in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor
18491: Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers
18492: of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he
18493: speaks again: but more wildly now.”
18494: 
18495: “Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his
18496: harpoon? Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game
18497: cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye
18498: that; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies
18499: game! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;
18500: died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
18501: Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he
18502: jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip,
18503: and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame
18504: upon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that
18505: jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”
18506: 
18507: During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
18508: was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
18509: 
18510: But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
18511: that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon
18512: there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some
18513: expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
18514: cause of his sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he
18515: had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
18516: and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
18517: he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter
18518: of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a
18519: word, it was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to
18520: live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,
18521: or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
18522: 
18523: Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
18524: that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,
18525: generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.
18526: So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after
18527: sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
18528: vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
18529: and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
18530: springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
18531: pronounced himself fit for a fight.
18532: 
18533: With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
18534: emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
18535: Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
18536: grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
18537: striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
18538: his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet
18539: and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written
18540: out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a
18541: mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in
18542: his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
18543: volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own
18544: live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore
18545: destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
18546: they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought
18547: it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,
18548: when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh,
18549: devilish tantalization of the gods!”
18550: 
18551: 
18552: CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.
18553: 
18554: When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
18555: South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
18556: Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
18557: youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
18558: thousand leagues of blue.
18559: 
18560: There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
18561: awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
18562: fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
18563: John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
18564: prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should
18565: rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of
18566: mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all
18567: that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing
18568: like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by
18569: their restlessness.
18570: 
18571: To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
18572: ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of
18573: the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same
18574: waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday
18575: planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
18576: gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
18577: float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
18578: Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine
18579: Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to
18580: it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal
18581: swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
18582: 
18583: But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
18584: statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
18585: nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles
18586: (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other
18587: consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
18588: which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at
18589: length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese
18590: cruising-ground, the old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm
18591: lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins
18592: swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran
18593: through the vaulted hull, “Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick
18594: blood!”
18595: 
18596: 
18597: CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.
18598: 
18599: Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
18600: these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
18601: shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old
18602: blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
18603: concluding his contributory work for Ahab’s leg, but still retained it
18604: on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost
18605: incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do
18606: some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
18607: various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an
18608: eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,
18609: pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every
18610: sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s was a
18611: patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no
18612: petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over
18613: still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil
18614: were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating
18615: of his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable!
18616: 
18617: A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
18618: yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
18619: curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
18620: questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
18621: one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
18622: 
18623: Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
18624: running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
18625: the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
18626: dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both
18627: feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
18628: acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied
18629: fifth act of the grief of his life’s drama.
18630: 
18631: He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
18632: encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been
18633: an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
18634: and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three
18635: blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
18636: planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further
18637: concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into
18638: his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
18639: tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
18640: his family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of
18641: that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,
18642: for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was
18643: in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
18644: that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
18645: unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing
18646: of her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled
18647: by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
18648: in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s
18649: infants were rocked to slumber.
18650: 
18651: Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
18652: Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came
18653: upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her
18654: orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after
18655: years; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked
18656: down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely
18657: hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than
18658: useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him
18659: easier to harvest.
18660: 
18661: Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew
18662: more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
18663: last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
18664: glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows
18665: fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
18666: dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed
18667: her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a
18668: vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to
18669: flaxen curls!
18670: 
18671: Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death
18672: is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but
18673: the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the
18674: Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
18675: such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions
18676: against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean
18677: alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking
18678: terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of
18679: infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—“Come hither,
18680: broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
18681: death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come
18682: hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
18683: abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put
18684: up _thy_ gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till
18685: we marry thee!”
18686: 
18687: Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
18688: fall of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth
18689: went a-whaling.
18690: 
18691: 
18692: CHAPTER 113. The Forge.
18693: 
18694: With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
18695: mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
18696: placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
18697: coals, and with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came
18698: along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
18699: yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,
18700: Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the
18701: anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
18702: some of which flew close to Ahab.
18703: 
18704: “Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying
18705: in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they
18706: burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”
18707: 
18708: “Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting
18709: for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st
18710: thou scorch a scar.”
18711: 
18712: “Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
18713: to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
18714: that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou
18715: not go mad? How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens
18716: yet hate thee, that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making
18717: there?”
18718: 
18719: “Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”
18720: 
18721: “And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
18722: usage as it had?”
18723: 
18724: “I think so, sir.”
18725: 
18726: “And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
18727: mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?”
18728: 
18729: “Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”
18730: 
18731: “Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
18732: with both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—_here_—can ye
18733: smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his
18734: ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my
18735: head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
18736: Answer! Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”
18737: 
18738: “Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
18739: 
18740: “Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
18741: though thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
18742: the bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s
18743: play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the
18744: leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon
18745: made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;
18746: something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the
18747: stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these
18748: are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”
18749: 
18750: “Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the
18751: best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”
18752: 
18753: “I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
18754: melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
18755: first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer
18756: these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!
18757: I’ll blow the fire.”
18758: 
18759: When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
18760: spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
18761: flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”
18762: 
18763: This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
18764: Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,
18765: with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to
18766: him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge
18767: shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and
18768: bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or
18769: some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
18770: 
18771: “What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered
18772: Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a
18773: fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”
18774: 
18775: At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
18776: Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
18777: by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.
18778: 
18779: “Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain;
18780: “have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”
18781: 
18782: “Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
18783: harpoon for the White Whale?”
18784: 
18785: “For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them
18786: thyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the
18787: barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”
18788: 
18789: For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
18790: fain not use them.
18791: 
18792: “Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
18793: nor pray till—but here—to work!”
18794: 
18795: Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
18796: shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
18797: blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
18798: tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
18799: 
18800: “No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
18801: there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
18802: as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster
18803: of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen
18804: flesh, and the White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.
18805: 
18806: “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”
18807: deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
18808: baptismal blood.
18809: 
18810: Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
18811: hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
18812: socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some
18813: fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.
18814: Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
18815: then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,
18816: “Good! and now for the seizings.”
18817: 
18818: At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
18819: were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole
18820: was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope
18821: was traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so,
18822: with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the
18823: Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
18824: the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory
18825: pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his
18826: cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was
18827: heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy
18828: strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
18829: melancholy ship, and mocked it!
18830: 
18831: 
18832: CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.
18833: 
18834: Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
18835: ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
18836: pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on
18837: the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or
18838: sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or
18839: seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small
18840: success for their pains.
18841: 
18842: At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
18843: heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
18844: sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
18845: cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
18846: quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
18847: ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
18848: would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
18849: remorseless fang.
18850: 
18851: These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
18852: certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
18853: regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
18854: only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
18855: rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when
18856: the western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their
18857: hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
18858: 
18859: The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
18860: there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
18861: children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
18862: the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most
18863: mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
18864: and form one seamless whole.
18865: 
18866: Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
18867: temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem
18868: to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath
18869: upon them prove but tarnishing.
18870: 
18871: Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
18872: ye,—though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye,
18873: men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some
18874: few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.
18875: Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling
18876: threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
18877: storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this
18878: life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one
18879: pause:—through infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless
18880: faith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then
18881: disbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But
18882: once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and
18883: men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor
18884: no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will
18885: never weary? Where is the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like
18886: those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
18887: our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.
18888: 
18889: And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
18890: same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—
18891: 
18892: “Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s
18893: eye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
18894: cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep
18895: down and do believe.”
18896: 
18897: And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
18898: golden light:—
18899: 
18900: “I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that
18901: he has always been jolly!”
18902: 
18903: 
18904: CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.
18905: 
18906: And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
18907: before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.
18908: 
18909: It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
18910: last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
18911: glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
18912: sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous
18913: to pointing her prow for home.
18914: 
18915: The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
18916: bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
18917: bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
18918: lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks
18919: of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways
18920: lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;
18921: above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of
18922: the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
18923: lamp.
18924: 
18925: As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most
18926: surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in
18927: the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without
18928: securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been
18929: given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional
18930: supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;
18931: and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and
18932: officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked
18933: into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an
18934: oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the
18935: forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,
18936: and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a
18937: head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged
18938: his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the
18939: sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was
18940: filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons pockets, and those
18941: he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of
18942: his entire satisfaction.
18943: 
18944: As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
18945: barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
18946: still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
18947: try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin
18948: of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
18949: clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and
18950: harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with
18951: them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,
18952: firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long
18953: Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
18954: presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s
18955: company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from
18956: which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought
18957: they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they
18958: raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the
18959: sea.
18960: 
18961: Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
18962: ship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
18963: full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
18964: diversion.
18965: 
18966: And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
18967: with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s
18968: wakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
18969: as to things to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the
18970: whole striking contrast of the scene.
18971: 
18972: “Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting
18973: a glass and a bottle in the air.
18974: 
18975: “Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.
18976: 
18977: “No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the
18978: other good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”
18979: 
18980: “Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”
18981: 
18982: “Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old
18983: hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come
18984: along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”
18985: 
18986: “How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art
18987: a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an
18988: empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward
18989: there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”
18990: 
18991: And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
18992: stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew
18993: of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the
18994: receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for
18995: the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the
18996: taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a
18997: small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed
18998: thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was
18999: filled with Nantucket soundings.
19000: 
19001: 
19002: CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.
19003: 
19004: Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
19005: sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
19006: rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed
19007: it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,
19008: whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
19009: 
19010: It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
19011: crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,
19012: sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and
19013: such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy
19014: air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent
19015: valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned
19016: sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
19017: 
19018: Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
19019: off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the
19020: now tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm
19021: whales dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that
19022: strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
19023: conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
19024: 
19025: “He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
19026: homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
19027: worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh
19028: that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.
19029: Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in
19030: these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
19031: furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still
19032: rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the
19033: Niger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;
19034: but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it
19035: heads some other way.
19036: 
19037: “Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
19038: thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;
19039: thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
19040: wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
19041: has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
19042: again, without a lesson to me.
19043: 
19044: “Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,
19045: rainbowed jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In
19046: vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
19047: sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou,
19048: darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy
19049: unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of
19050: once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.
19051: 
19052: “Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
19053: fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though
19054: hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”
19055: 
19056: 
19057: CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.
19058: 
19059: The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
19060: windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These
19061: last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
19062: could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
19063: by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.
19064: 
19065: The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and
19066: the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon
19067: the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
19068: gently chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
19069: 
19070: Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
19071: crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
19072: round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A
19073: sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
19074: ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
19075: 
19076: Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
19077: hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
19078: flooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.
19079: 
19080: “Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
19081: coffin can be thine?”
19082: 
19083: “And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”
19084: 
19085: “But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
19086: hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
19087: mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
19088: America.”
19089: 
19090: “Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes
19091: floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
19092: sight we shall not soon see.”
19093: 
19094: “Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”
19095: 
19096: “And what was that saying about thyself?”
19097: 
19098: “Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”
19099: 
19100: “And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere I can
19101: follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it not so?
19102: Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
19103: pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”
19104: 
19105: “Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
19106: like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”
19107: 
19108: “The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried
19109: Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”
19110: 
19111: Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
19112: slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead
19113: whale was brought to the ship.
19114: 
19115: 
19116: CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.
19117: 
19118: The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
19119: coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
19120: ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
19121: the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
19122: on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s
19123: prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon
19124: high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
19125: about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
19126: latitude.
19127: 
19128: Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
19129: effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
19130: focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks
19131: lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
19132: nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
19133: God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured
19134: glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging
19135: his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
19136: astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that
19137: posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun
19138: should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention
19139: was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,
19140: and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;
19141: only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was
19142: subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
19143: observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab
19144: soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then
19145: falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and
19146: murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou
19147: tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where
19148: I _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is
19149: this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be
19150: eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now
19151: beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding
19152: the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”
19153: 
19154: Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
19155: numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
19156: “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
19157: and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
19158: what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
19159: thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
19160: holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of
19161: water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
19162: impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;
19163: and cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,
19164: whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now
19165: scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon
19166: are the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as
19167: if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou
19168: quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly
19169: way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by
19170: log and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the
19171: sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,
19172: thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and
19173: destroy thee!”
19174: 
19175: As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
19176: dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
19177: fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the
19178: mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
19179: while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
19180: together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,
19181: shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”
19182: 
19183: In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
19184: her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
19185: long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one
19186: sufficient steed.
19187: 
19188: Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s
19189: tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.
19190: 
19191: “I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
19192: of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
19193: down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
19194: thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”
19195: 
19196: “Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.
19197: Starbuck—sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab
19198: mutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of
19199: mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab,
19200: but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!”
19201: 
19202: 
19203: CHAPTER 119. The Candles.
19204: 
19205: Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
19206: crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most
19207: effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
19208: tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in
19209: these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of
19210: all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that
19211: cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.
19212: 
19213: Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
19214: bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
19215: ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
19216: thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
19217: fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
19218: tempest had left for its after sport.
19219: 
19220: Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
19221: every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
19222: disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
19223: and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
19224: lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted
19225: to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did
19226: not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling
19227: ship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,
19228: and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.
19229: 
19230: “Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
19231: “but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You
19232: see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
19233: all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,
19234: all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But
19235: never mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)
19236: 
19237: 
19238:   Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A’ flourishin’ his
19239:   tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the
19240:   Ocean, oh!
19241: 
19242:   The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in
19243:   the spicin’,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
19244:   is the Ocean, oh!
19245: 
19246:   Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of
19247:   this flip,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
19248:   is the Ocean, oh!
19249: 
19250: 
19251: 
19252: “Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
19253: harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
19254: thy peace.”
19255: 
19256: “But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
19257: and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.
19258: Starbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
19259: throat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a
19260: wind-up.”
19261: 
19262: “Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”
19263: 
19264: “What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
19265: mind how foolish?”
19266: 
19267: “Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
19268: hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes
19269: from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the
19270: very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where
19271: is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his
19272: stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
19273: must!
19274: 
19275: “I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”
19276: 
19277: “Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to
19278: Nantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s
19279: question. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
19280: into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,
19281: all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up
19282: there; but not with the lightning.”
19283: 
19284: At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
19285: the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
19286: instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
19287: 
19288: “Who’s there?”
19289: 
19290: “Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
19291: pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
19292: lances of fire.
19293: 
19294: Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
19295: the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
19296: ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But
19297: as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
19298: avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
19299: towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
19300: not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
19301: vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
19302: ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
19303: in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
19304: chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.
19305: 
19306: “The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
19307: to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
19308: flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them
19309: over, fore and aft. Quick!”
19310: 
19311: “Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the
19312: weaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
19313: Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let
19314: them be, sir.”
19315: 
19316: “Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”
19317: 
19318: All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
19319: tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
19320: the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
19321: three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
19322: 
19323: “Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
19324: sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
19325: jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping
19326: backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
19327: immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us
19328: all!”
19329: 
19330: To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
19331: the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
19332: from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething
19333: sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when
19334: God’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,
19335: Tekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
19336: 
19337: While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
19338: enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
19339: their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
19340: constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the
19341: gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
19342: seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted
19343: mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
19344: gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
19345: the preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue
19346: flames on his body.
19347: 
19348: The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more
19349: the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment
19350: or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.
19351: It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not
19352: the same in the song.”
19353: 
19354: “No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
19355: hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have
19356: they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark
19357: to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
19358: of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
19359: chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will
19360: work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will
19361: yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”
19362: 
19363: At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning
19364: to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once
19365: more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
19366: supernaturalness in their pallor.
19367: 
19368: “The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.
19369: 
19370: At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
19371: the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away
19372: from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
19373: they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
19374: arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a
19375: knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various
19376: enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running
19377: skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all
19378: their eyes upcast.
19379: 
19380: “Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white
19381: flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast
19382: links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
19383: it; blood against fire! So.”
19384: 
19385: Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
19386: upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
19387: he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
19388: 
19389: “Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
19390: once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
19391: to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I
19392: now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor
19393: reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and
19394: all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,
19395: placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
19396: dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of
19397: the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a
19398: point at best; whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go; yet while I
19399: earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal
19400: rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of
19401: love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere
19402: supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted
19403: worlds, there’s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou
19404: clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of
19405: fire, I breathe it back to thee.”
19406: 
19407: [_Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap
19408: lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes
19409: his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them._]
19410: 
19411: “I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung
19412: from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can
19413: then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the
19414: homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The
19415: lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my
19416: whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning
19417: ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though
19418: thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of
19419: light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
19420: There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my
19421: genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know
19422: not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but
19423: thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself
19424: unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself
19425: unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou
19426: omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear
19427: spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness
19428: mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly
19429: see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast
19430: thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with
19431: haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap
19432: with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly
19433: I worship thee!”
19434: 
19435: “The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”
19436: 
19437: Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed
19438: in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s
19439: bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
19440: sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a
19441: levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there
19442: like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is
19443: against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
19444: continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
19445: fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”
19446: 
19447: Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
19448: braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast
19449: mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But
19450: dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the
19451: burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to
19452: transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.
19453: Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
19454: that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—
19455: 
19456: “All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
19457: heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye
19458: may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
19459: the last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
19460: flame.
19461: 
19462: As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
19463: some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it
19464: so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
19465: thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did
19466: run from him in a terror of dismay.

19471: _Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him._
19472: 
19473: “We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working
19474: loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”
19475: 
19476: “Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up
19477: now.”
19478: 
19479: “Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”
19480: 
19481: “Well.”
19482: 
19483: “The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”
19484: 
19485: “Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
19486: but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.—By
19487: masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some
19488: coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest
19489: trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now
19490: sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards
19491: send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft
19492: there! I would e’en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic
19493: is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!”

19497: 
19498: _Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over
19499: the anchors there hanging._
19500: 
19501: “No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
19502: you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how
19503: long ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say
19504: that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra
19505: on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder
19506: barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn’t you say
19507: so?”
19508: 
19509: “Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that
19510: time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we _are_ loaded with powder
19511: barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
19512: afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
19513: red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re
19514: Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
19515: collar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine
19516: Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.
19517: But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First take your
19518: leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the
19519: rope; now listen. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s
19520: lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn’t
19521: got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don’t you see, you
19522: timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the
19523: mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in
19524: a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no
19525: more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
19526: thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose
19527: you would have every man in the world go about with a small
19528: lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
19529: officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
19530: don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye,
19531: then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.”
19532: 
19533: “I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”
19534: 
19535: “Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s
19536: a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the
19537: turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
19538: now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two
19539: anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And
19540: what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron
19541: fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the
19542: world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long
19543: cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next
19544: to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,
19545: just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at
19546: long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always
19547: to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,
19548: serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with cocked hats; the
19549: cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and
19550: tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a
19551: beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,
19552: Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
19553: This is a nasty night, lad.”

19559: 
19560: “Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What’s
19561: the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don’t want thunder; we want rum;
19562: give us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!”
19563: 
19564: 
19565: CHAPTER 123. The Musket.
19566: 
19567: During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s
19568: jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
19569: its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
19570: to it—for they were slack—because some play to the tiller was
19571: indispensable.
19572: 
19573: In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
19574: to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
19575: compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the
19576: Pequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
19577: the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a
19578: sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
19579: emotion.
19580: 
19581: Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
19582: strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the
19583: other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
19584: were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
19585: the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds
19586: when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
19587: 
19588: The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
19589: storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
19590: the water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,
19591: East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
19592: given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
19593: steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the
19594: ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,
19595: lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul
19596: breeze became fair!
19597: 
19598: Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “_Ho! the fair
19599: wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_” the crew singing for joy, that so
19600: promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
19601: preceding it.
19602: 
19603: In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report
19604: immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
19605: change in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the
19606: yards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he
19607: mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
19608: 
19609: Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
19610: moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning
19611: fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man’s bolted door,—a
19612: thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The
19613: isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence
19614: to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
19615: elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as
19616: they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an
19617: honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck’s heart, at that instant when
19618: he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so
19619: blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he
19620: hardly knew it for itself.
19621: 
19622: “He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the very
19623: musket that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me
19624: touch it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly
19625: lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye,
19626: aye; and powder in the pan;—that’s not good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll
19627: cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly while I think.—I come
19628: to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and
19629: doom,—_that’s_ fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair
19630: for that accursed fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one;
19631: _this_ one—I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing
19632: I handle now.—Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say
19633: he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his
19634: heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his
19635: way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very
19636: Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But
19637: shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship’s
19638: company down to doom with him?—Yes, it would make him the wilful
19639: murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;
19640: and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have
19641: his way. If, then, he were this instant—put aside, that crime would not
19642: be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,—in there,
19643: he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I
19644: can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;
19645: not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat
19646: obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye,
19647: and say’st the men have vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us are Ahabs.
19648: Great God forbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful way?—Make him a
19649: prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man’s living
19650: power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were
19651: pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to
19652: ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged
19653: tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his
19654: howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me
19655: on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is
19656: hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone
19657: here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me
19658: and law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is heaven a murderer when its lightning
19659: strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin
19660: together?—And would I be a murderer, then, if”—and slowly, stealthily,
19661: and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket’s end against
19662: the door.
19663: 
19664: “On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way. A
19665: touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh
19666: Mary! Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
19667: who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck’s body this day week may
19668: sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall
19669: I?—The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
19670: are reefed and set; she heads her course.”
19671: 
19672: “Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”
19673: 
19674: Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s
19675: tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream
19676: to speak.
19677: 
19678: The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel;
19679: Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
19680: placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
19681: 
19682: “He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
19683: him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”
19684: 
19685: 
19686: CHAPTER 124. The Needle.
19687: 
19688: Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
19689: mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on
19690: like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
19691: so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world
19692: boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the
19693: invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;
19694: where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned
19695: Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a
19696: crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
19697: 
19698: Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
19699: the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to
19700: eye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly
19701: settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward
19702: place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating
19703: wake.
19704: 
19705: “Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
19706: of the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to
19707: ye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”
19708: 
19709: But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
19710: the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
19711: 
19712: “East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.
19713: 
19714: “Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this
19715: hour in the morning, and the sun astern?”
19716: 
19717: Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
19718: observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
19719: blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
19720: 
19721: Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse
19722: of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
19723: seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two
19724: compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
19725: 
19726: But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
19727: old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened
19728: before. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s
19729: all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”
19730: 
19731: “Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
19732: gloomily.
19733: 
19734: Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
19735: one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
19736: developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
19737: with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
19738: marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning
19739: has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars
19740: and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more
19741: fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before
19742: magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.
19743: But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the
19744: original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be
19745: affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;
19746: even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
19747: 
19748: Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
19749: compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
19750: the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
19751: exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be
19752: changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod
19753: thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
19754: one had only been juggling her.
19755: 
19756: Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
19757: nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
19758: Flask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
19759: feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some
19760: of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear
19761: of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost
19762: wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain
19763: magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.
19764: 
19765: For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But
19766: chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
19767: sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
19768: 
19769: “Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked
19770: thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But
19771: Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without
19772: a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.
19773: Quick!”
19774: 
19775: Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
19776: to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
19777: revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
19778: matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old
19779: man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
19780: practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious
19781: sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.
19782: 
19783: “Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him
19784: the things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s
19785: needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,
19786: that will point as true as any.”
19787: 
19788: Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
19789: this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
19790: might follow. But Starbuck looked away.
19791: 
19792: With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
19793: lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
19794: him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the
19795: maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
19796: placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
19797: hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.
19798: Then going through some small strange motions with it—whether
19799: indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to
19800: augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;
19801: and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,
19802: and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of
19803: the compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering
19804: and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when
19805: Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly
19806: back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,
19807: exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level
19808: loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”
19809: 
19810: One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
19811: persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk
19812: away.
19813: 
19814: In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
19815: fatal pride.
19816: 
19817: 
19818: CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
19819: 
19820: While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
19821: and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
19822: upon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen,
19823: and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave
19824: the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake
19825: than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
19826: course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
19827: progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
19828: reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
19829: railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
19830: wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
19831: hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
19832: happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet
19833: scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his
19834: frantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing
19835: plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
19836: 
19837: “Forward, there! Heave the log!”
19838: 
19839: Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
19840: “Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”
19841: 
19842: They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the
19843: deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
19844: the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
19845: 
19846: The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
19847: handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
19848: stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to
19849: him.
19850: 
19851: Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
19852: turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
19853: Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
19854: speak.
19855: 
19856: “Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
19857: spoiled it.”
19858: 
19859: “’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
19860: Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”
19861: 
19862: “I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey
19863: hairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a
19864: superior, who’ll ne’er confess.”
19865: 
19866: “What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
19867: granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
19868: thou born?”
19869: 
19870: “In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”
19871: 
19872: “Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”
19873: 
19874: “I know not, sir, but I was born there.”
19875: 
19876: “In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man
19877: from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
19878: which is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
19879: butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”
19880: 
19881: The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
19882: dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
19883: turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
19884: resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
19885: 
19886: “Hold hard!”
19887: 
19888: Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
19889: tugging log was gone.
19890: 
19891: “I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
19892: sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
19893: reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
19894: mend thou the line. See to it.”
19895: 
19896: “There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer
19897: seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,
19898: Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and
19899: dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”
19900: 
19901: “Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing.
19902: Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags
19903: hard; I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul
19904: in no cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!
19905: a hatchet! cut it off—we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
19906: sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”
19907: 
19908: “Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
19909: “Away from the quarter-deck!”
19910: 
19911: “The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
19912: “Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
19913: 
19914: “Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”
19915: 
19916: “And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
19917: thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to
19918: sieve through! Who art thou, boy?”
19919: 
19920: “Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One
19921: hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks
19922: cowardly—quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip the
19923: coward?”
19924: 
19925: “There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!
19926: look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
19927: him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s
19928: home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;
19929: thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s
19930: down.”
19931: 
19932: “What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s
19933: hand, and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing
19934: as this, perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a
19935: man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth
19936: now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the
19937: white, for I will not let this go.”
19938: 
19939: “Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
19940: horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in
19941: gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
19942: oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not
19943: what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!
19944: I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
19945: Emperor’s!”
19946: 
19947: “There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One daft with
19948: strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’s the end of the
19949: rotten line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a
19950: new line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”
19951: 
19952: 
19953: CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.
19954: 
19955: Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress
19956: solely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her
19957: path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
19958: unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways
19959: impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all
19960: these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and
19961: desperate scene.
19962: 
19963: At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
19964: Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
19965: the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then
19966: headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
19967: unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod’s
19968: murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their reveries,
19969: and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
19970: transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild
19971: cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the
19972: crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers
19973: remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of
19974: all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the
19975: voices of newly drowned men in the sea.
19976: 
19977: Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
19978: came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
19979: unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus
19980: explained the wonder.
19981: 
19982: Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
19983: numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
19984: some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
19985: kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
19986: wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most
19987: mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not
19988: only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the
19989: human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
19990: peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain
19991: circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.
19992: 
19993: But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
19994: confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At
19995: sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
19996: and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
19997: sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus
19998: with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had
19999: not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a
20000: rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
20001: looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
20002: sea.
20003: 
20004: The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it
20005: always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
20006: and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
20007: slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and
20008: the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
20009: yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
20010: 
20011: And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out
20012: for the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man
20013: was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the
20014: time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
20015: least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of
20016: evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.
20017: They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they
20018: had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
20019: 
20020: The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see
20021: to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in
20022: the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the
20023: voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
20024: connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;
20025: therefore, they were going to leave the ship’s stern unprovided with a
20026: buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a
20027: hint concerning his coffin.
20028: 
20029: “A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.
20030: 
20031: “Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.
20032: 
20033: “It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can
20034: arrange it easily.”
20035: 
20036: “Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a
20037: melancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the coffin,
20038: I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”
20039: 
20040: “And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.
20041: 
20042: “Aye.”
20043: 
20044: “And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a
20045: caulking-iron.
20046: 
20047: “Aye.”
20048: 
20049: “And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand
20050: as with a pitch-pot.
20051: 
20052: “Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and
20053: no more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”
20054: 
20055: “He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he
20056: baulks. Now I don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he
20057: wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he
20058: won’t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with
20059: that coffin? And now I’m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like
20060: turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I
20061: don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s
20062: undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we
20063: are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,
20064: fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at
20065: the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at
20066: the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle,
20067: and at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be
20068: giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for
20069: tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a
20070: bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would work
20071: for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
20072: Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run
20073: off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let
20074: me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with
20075: pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over
20076: the ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some
20077: superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere
20078: they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I
20079: don’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard
20080: tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and
20081: card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or
20082: by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore
20083: of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it
20084: if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s
20085: see—how many in the ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any
20086: way, I’ll have me thirty separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three
20087: feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,
20088: there’ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight
20089: not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,
20090: pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s to it.”
20091: 
20092: 
20093: CHAPTER 127. The Deck.
20094: 
20095: _The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the
20096: open hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted
20097: oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of
20098: his frock.—Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip
20099: following him._
20100: 
20101: “Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
20102: complies with my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle aisle of a
20103: church! What’s here?”
20104: 
20105: “Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
20106: hatchway!”
20107: 
20108: “Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”
20109: 
20110: “Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”
20111: 
20112: “Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy
20113: shop?”
20114: 
20115: “I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”
20116: 
20117: “Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”
20118: 
20119: “Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
20120: they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”
20121: 
20122: “Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
20123: monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
20124: next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
20125: same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
20126: jack-of-all-trades.”
20127: 
20128: “But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”
20129: 
20130: “The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
20131: coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
20132: craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in
20133: hand. Dost thou never?”
20134: 
20135: “Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but
20136: the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there
20137: was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark
20138: to it.”
20139: 
20140: “Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in
20141: all things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And
20142: yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
20143: Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against
20144: the churchyard gate, going in?
20145: 
20146: “Faith, sir, I’ve——”
20147: 
20148: “Faith? What’s that?”
20149: 
20150: “Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all,
20151: sir.”
20152: 
20153: “Um, um; go on.”
20154: 
20155: “I was about to say, sir, that——”
20156: 
20157: “Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
20158: Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.”
20159: 
20160: “He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
20161: latitudes. I’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
20162: Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some
20163: sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He’s always
20164: under the Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way—come, oakum;
20165: quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I’m the
20166: professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”
20167: 
20168: (_Ahab to himself_.)
20169: 
20170: “There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker tapping
20171: the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
20172: thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag,
20173: that fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
20174: materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
20175: now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
20176: expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A
20177: life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some
20178: spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!
20179: I’ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth,
20180: that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain
20181: twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed
20182: sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.
20183: Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous
20184: philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds
20185: must empty into thee!”
20186: 
20187: 
20188: CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
20189: 
20190: Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
20191: upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
20192: the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
20193: broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
20194: fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
20195: the smitten hull.
20196: 
20197: “Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
20198: commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
20199: could hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.
20200: 
20201: “Hast seen the White Whale?”
20202: 
20203: “Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”
20204: 
20205: Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
20206: and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger
20207: captain himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending
20208: her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the
20209: Pequod’s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was
20210: recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation
20211: was exchanged.
20212: 
20213: “Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing.
20214: “How was it?”
20215: 
20216: It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
20217: while three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of
20218: whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
20219: while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head
20220: of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to
20221: leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been
20222: instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this
20223: fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in
20224: fastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
20225: anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
20226: and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing
20227: more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
20228: indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was
20229: some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals
20230: were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
20231: three far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the
20232: precisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to
20233: leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
20234: increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last
20235: safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the
20236: missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every
20237: other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a
20238: sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when
20239: last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all
20240: around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again
20241: paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing
20242: till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been
20243: seen.
20244: 
20245: The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
20246: object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his
20247: own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
20248: apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
20249: 
20250: “I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one
20251: in that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his
20252: watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
20253: pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height
20254: of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in
20255: the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been
20256: the—”
20257: 
20258: “My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I
20259: conjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had
20260: but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me
20261: charter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if
20262: there be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you
20263: must, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”
20264: 
20265: “His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the
20266: coat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”
20267: 
20268: “He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx
20269: sailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”
20270: 
20271: Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s
20272: the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
20273: Captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among
20274: the number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the
20275: other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the
20276: chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the
20277: wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;
20278: which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively
20279: adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,
20280: that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to
20281: pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown
20282: constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not
20283: till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet
20284: missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the
20285: earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had
20286: thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a
20287: vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it
20288: unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such
20289: tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage
20290: in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a
20291: whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
20292: father’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
20293: concern.
20294: 
20295: Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
20296: and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
20297: the least quivering of his own.
20298: 
20299: “I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me
20300: as you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a
20301: boy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
20302: child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,
20303: now, and stand by to square in the yards.”
20304: 
20305: “Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
20306: prolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
20307: Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
20308: forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle
20309: watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all
20310: strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”
20311: 
20312: Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
20313: leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
20314: rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,
20315: Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
20316: boat, and returned to his ship.
20317: 
20318: Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
20319: was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
20320: however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung
20321: round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat
20322: against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the
20323: while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three
20324: tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
20325: 
20326: But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
20327: saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
20328: comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
20329: not.
20330: 
20331: 
20332: CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.
20333: 
20334: (_Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)
20335: 
20336: “Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is
20337: coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee
20338: by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my
20339: malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most
20340: desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
20341: as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own
20342: screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.”
20343: 
20344: “No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
20345: your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain
20346: a part of ye.”
20347: 
20348: “Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
20349: fidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like
20350: applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”
20351: 
20352: “They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
20353: drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
20354: But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
20355: ye.”
20356: 
20357: “If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him.
20358: I tell thee no; it cannot be.”
20359: 
20360: “Oh good master, master, master!
20361: 
20362: “Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
20363: Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
20364: know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art
20365: thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
20366: thee; and if it come to that,—God for ever save thee, let what will
20367: befall.”
20368: 
20369: (_Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward._)
20370: 
20371: “Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now
20372: were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
20373: Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the
20374: door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening
20375: it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me
20376: this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against the
20377: transom, in the ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts
20378: before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours
20379: great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of
20380: captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s this? epaulets! epaulets! the
20381: epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye;
20382: fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy’s host
20383: to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs, have ye seen
20384: one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and
20385: cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him? No! Well then, fill
20386: up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no
20387: names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all
20388: cowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory—Oh, master! master! I am
20389: indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here I’ll stay, though
20390: this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to
20391: join me.”
20392: 
20393: 
20394: CHAPTER 130. The Hat.
20395: 
20396: And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
20397: preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have
20398: chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;
20399: now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
20400: where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had
20401: been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered
20402: Moby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships
20403: contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which
20404: the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;
20405: now it was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which
20406: it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting
20407: polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’ night
20408: sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now
20409: fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
20410: domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
20411: fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
20412: single spear or leaf.
20413: 
20414: In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
20415: vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more
20416: strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
20417: ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
20418: mortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the
20419: deck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them.
20420: 
20421: But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
20422: he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
20423: even as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance
20424: awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
20425: Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
20426: now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
20427: at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
20428: substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
20429: being’s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by
20430: night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
20431: below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
20432: but wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.
20433: 
20434: Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
20435: deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,
20436: or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the
20437: main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
20438: cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;
20439: his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he
20440: stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
20441: in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
20442: tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
20443: times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,
20444: though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and
20445: the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved
20446: coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s
20447: sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;
20448: he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin
20449: that thing he sent for.
20450: 
20451: He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast and
20452: dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
20453: grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still
20454: grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But
20455: though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the
20456: Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these
20457: two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals
20458: some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
20459: spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
20460: crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak
20461: one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
20462: slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a
20463: single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his
20464: scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each
20465: other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the
20466: Parsee his abandoned substance.
20467: 
20468: And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
20469: and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab
20470: seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
20471: seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean
20472: shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and
20473: keel was solid Ahab.
20474: 
20475: At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
20476: from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after
20477: sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking
20478: of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”
20479: 
20480: But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
20481: children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
20482: old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly
20483: all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether
20484: Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But
20485: if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from
20486: verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
20487: 
20488: “I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab
20489: must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
20490: basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
20491: block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
20492: downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin
20493: for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with
20494: that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round
20495: upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long
20496: upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then
20497: settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the
20498: rope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his
20499: person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his
20500: perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and
20501: afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the
20502: royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,
20503: astern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded
20504: at so great a height.
20505: 
20506: When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
20507: the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is
20508: hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
20509: circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict
20510: charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such
20511: a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations
20512: aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at
20513: the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few
20514: minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural
20515: fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor
20516: should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all
20517: swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not
20518: unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,
20519: almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with
20520: anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those
20521: too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt
20522: somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select
20523: for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise
20524: distrusted person’s hands.
20525: 
20526: Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
20527: minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
20528: incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
20529: latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
20530: head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a
20531: thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and
20532: went eddying again round his head.
20533: 
20534: But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
20535: not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
20536: it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least
20537: heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
20538: sight.
20539: 
20540: “Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
20541: being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though
20542: somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
20543: them.
20544: 
20545: But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long
20546: hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with
20547: his prize.
20548: 
20549: An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace
20550: it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be
20551: king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
20552: accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on
20553: and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;
20554: while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was
20555: dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.
20556: 
20557: 
20558: CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.
20559: 
20560: The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
20561: life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
20562: misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
20563: fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
20564: whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
20565: feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
20566: 
20567: Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
20568: some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
20569: now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
20570: half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
20571: 
20572: “Hast seen the White Whale?”
20573: 
20574: “Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with
20575: his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
20576: 
20577: “Hast killed him?”
20578: 
20579: “The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the
20580: other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
20581: gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
20582: 
20583: “Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
20584: held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold
20585: his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
20586: barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the
20587: fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”
20588: 
20589: “Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the
20590: hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
20591: yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest
20592: were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning
20593: to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
20594: lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with
20595: uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”
20596: 
20597: “Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
20598: 
20599: But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
20600: sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not
20601: so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
20602: sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.
20603: 
20604: As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
20605: hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.
20606: 
20607: “Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
20608: “In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
20609: taffrail to show us your coffin!”
20610: 
20611: 
20612: CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.
20613: 
20614: It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were
20615: hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
20616: transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and
20617: man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s
20618: chest in his sleep.
20619: 
20620: Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
20621: unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
20622: but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
20623: mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
20624: troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
20625: 
20626: But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
20627: shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
20628: that distinguished them.
20629: 
20630: Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
20631: air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the
20632: girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen
20633: here at the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
20634: alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
20635: 
20636: Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm
20637: and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
20638: ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
20639: morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s
20640: forehead of heaven.
20641: 
20642: Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
20643: creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
20644: oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
20645: little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
20646: their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
20647: the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
20648: 
20649: Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
20650: and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the
20651: more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the
20652: lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a
20653: moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that
20654: winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,
20655: so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn
20656: neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that
20657: however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save
20658: and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into
20659: the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee
20660: drop.
20661: 
20662: Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
20663: and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing
20664: that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to
20665: touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood
20666: there.
20667: 
20668: Ahab turned.
20669: 
20670: “Starbuck!”
20671: 
20672: “Sir.”
20673: 
20674: “Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such
20675: a day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a
20676: boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty
20677: years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
20678: storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
20679: forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
20680: of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
20681: spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the
20682: desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a
20683: Captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
20684: sympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!
20685: Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—when I think of all this;
20686: only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty
20687: years I have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment
20688: of my soil!—when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily
20689: hand, and broken the world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away,
20690: whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
20691: sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage
20692: pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I
20693: widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the
20694: madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with
20695: which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly
20696: chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’
20697: fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase?
20698: why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?
20699: how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not
20700: hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been
20701: snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,
20702: that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some
20703: ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel
20704: deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering
20705: beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my
20706: heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey
20707: hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus
20708: intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a
20709: human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to
20710: gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
20711: the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
20712: stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives
20713: chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
20714: the far away home I see in that eye!”
20715: 
20716: “Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
20717: why should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us
20718: fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are
20719: Starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
20720: youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
20721: longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter
20722: the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl
20723: on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some
20724: such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”
20725: 
20726: “They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the
20727: morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy
20728: vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
20729: cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
20730: to dance him again.”
20731: 
20732: “’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every
20733: morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
20734: his father’s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
20735: Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
20736: See, see! the boy’s face from the window! the boy’s hand on the hill!”
20737: 
20738: But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
20739: cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
20740: 
20741: “What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
20742: cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
20743: commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
20744: pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
20745: making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not
20746: so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this
20747: arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
20748: in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible
20749: power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain
20750: think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does
20751: that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round
20752: in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all
20753: the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon
20754: Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where
20755: do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged
20756: to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
20757: the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have
20758: been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and
20759: the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we
20760: how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust
20761: amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the
20762: half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”
20763: 
20764: But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
20765: 
20766: Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
20767: two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
20768: leaning over the same rail.
20769: 
20770: 
20771: CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.
20772: 
20773: That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at
20774: intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
20775: to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
20776: up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
20777: barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
20778: peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living
20779: sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner
20780: surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,
20781: and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as
20782: possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly
20783: altered, and the sail to be shortened.
20784: 
20785: The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
20786: at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
20787: lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
20788: wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
20789: tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
20790: 
20791: “Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”
20792: 
20793: Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
20794: deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
20795: seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
20796: with their clothes in their hands.
20797: 
20798: “What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
20799: 
20800: “Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.
20801: 
20802: “T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”
20803: 
20804: All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
20805: swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
20806: hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and
20807: while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
20808: main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
20809: air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
20810: Moby Dick!”
20811: 
20812: Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
20813: look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
20814: whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final
20815: perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
20816: beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s
20817: head was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale
20818: was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
20819: his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into
20820: the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they
20821: had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
20822: 
20823: “And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
20824: all around him.
20825: 
20826: “I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
20827: cried out,” said Tashtego.
20828: 
20829: “Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
20830: reserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised
20831: the White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she
20832: blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,
20833: methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s
20834: visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
20835: top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay
20836: on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;
20837: steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All
20838: ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;
20839: lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.
20840: 
20841: “He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from
20842: us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”
20843: 
20844: “Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!
20845: Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”
20846: 
20847: Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails
20848: set—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
20849: leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
20850: Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
20851: 
20852: Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
20853: but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
20854: still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
20855: noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter
20856: came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling
20857: hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated
20858: thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,
20859: greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly
20860: projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged
20861: waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
20862: forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and
20863: behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving
20864: valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and
20865: danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of
20866: hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their
20867: fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull
20868: of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected
20869: from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of
20870: soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
20871: the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail
20872: feathers streaming like pennons.
20873: 
20874: A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
20875: the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
20876: ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
20877: eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,
20878: rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that
20879: great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so
20880: divinely swam.
20881: 
20882: On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once
20883: leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale
20884: shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
20885: namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
20886: to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
20887: tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
20888: who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
20889: thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
20890: 
20891: And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
20892: waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby
20893: Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
20894: submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
20895: But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an
20896: instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s
20897: Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,
20898: the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.
20899: Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls
20900: longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.
20901: 
20902: With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
20903: the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.
20904: 
20905: “An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed
20906: beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
20907: vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
20908: whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze
20909: now freshened; the sea began to swell.
20910: 
20911: “The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.
20912: 
20913: In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
20914: all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began
20915: fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
20916: expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could
20917: discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down
20918: into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a
20919: white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it
20920: rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long
20921: crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the
20922: undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;
20923: his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.
20924: The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble
20925: tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled
20926: the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon
20927: Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
20928: seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
20929: stand by to stern.
20930: 
20931: Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
20932: its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet
20933: under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that
20934: malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
20935: himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
20936: lengthwise beneath the boat.
20937: 
20938: Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
20939: an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a
20940: biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
20941: mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
20942: the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
20943: pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s
20944: head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale
20945: now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
20946: unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
20947: tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the
20948: uttermost stern.
20949: 
20950: And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
20951: whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
20952: body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
20953: the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while
20954: the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
20955: impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
20956: this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
20957: helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized
20958: the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
20959: its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
20960: frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
20961: enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in
20962: twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the
20963: two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the
20964: crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold
20965: fast to the oars to lash them across.
20966: 
20967: At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
20968: to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
20969: movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
20970: made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only
20971: slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as
20972: it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him
20973: out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the
20974: sea.
20975: 
20976: Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
20977: distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
20978: billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;
20979: so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet
20980: out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
20981: dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray
20982: still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel
20983: billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to
20984: overleap its summit with their scud.
20985: 
20986: *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its
20987: designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary
20988: up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
20989: pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best
20990: and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.
20991: 
20992: But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
20993: and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
20994: wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly
20995: assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the
20996: blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the
20997: book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the
20998: whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he
20999: could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;
21000: helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least
21001: chance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah
21002: incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other
21003: drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to
21004: look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s
21005: aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,
21006: that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other
21007: boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into
21008: the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
21009: destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
21010: case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,
21011: they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had
21012: now become the old man’s head.
21013: 
21014: Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s
21015: mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
21016: and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on
21017: the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and
21018: whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing
21019: to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him
21020: off!”
21021: 
21022: The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
21023: she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly
21024: swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.
21025: 
21026: Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
21027: brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily
21028: strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a
21029: time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden
21030: under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from
21031: him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.
21032: 
21033: But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
21034: abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
21035: to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
21036: through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary
21037: in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
21038: aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
21039: intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures
21040: contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.
21041: 
21042: “The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
21043: one bended arm—“is it safe?”
21044: 
21045: “Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.
21046: 
21047: “Lay it before me;—any missing men?”
21048: 
21049: “One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are
21050: five men.”
21051: 
21052: “That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
21053: there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!
21054: The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;
21055: the helm!”
21056: 
21057: It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
21058: up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is
21059: thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.
21060: But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the
21061: whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with
21062: a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these
21063: circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely
21064: prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long
21065: a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing
21066: barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,
21067: then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate
21068: means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,
21069: and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked
21070: boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything
21071: to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways
21072: outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an
21073: albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
21074: the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was
21075: regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
21076: reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing
21077: the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
21078: allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?
21079: D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded
21080: them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now
21081: aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
21082: 
21083: As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
21084: aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a
21085: still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,
21086: at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped
21087: upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered
21088: stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded
21089: sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old
21090: man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.
21091: 
21092: Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
21093: evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
21094: his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The
21095: thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”
21096: 
21097: “What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did
21098: I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could
21099: swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a
21100: wreck.”
21101: 
21102: “Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,
21103: and an ill one.”
21104: 
21105: “Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
21106: man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
21107: give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
21108: of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye
21109: two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the
21110: peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
21111: now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he
21112: spout ten times a second!”
21113: 
21114: The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
21115: Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
21116: 
21117: “Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.
21118: 
21119: “How heading when last seen?”
21120: 
21121: “As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”
21122: 
21123: “Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and
21124: top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before
21125: morning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm
21126: there! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send
21127: a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till
21128: morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,
21129: this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till
21130: the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,
21131: upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on
21132: that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be
21133: divided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”
21134: 
21135: And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
21136: slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
21137: rousing himself to see how the night wore on.
21138: 
21139: 
21140: CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.
21141: 
21142: At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
21143: 
21144: “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light
21145: to spread.
21146: 
21147: “See nothing, sir.”
21148: 
21149: “Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
21150: for;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all
21151: night. But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”
21152: 
21153: Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
21154: whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is
21155: a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is
21156: the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
21157: confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket
21158: commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last
21159: descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty
21160: accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to
21161: swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of
21162: progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a
21163: pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he
21164: well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at
21165: some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes
21166: the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more
21167: certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be
21168: visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for
21169: after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of
21170: daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future
21171: wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious
21172: mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this
21173: hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in
21174: water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the
21175: steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
21176: is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
21177: hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly
21178: say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a
21179: spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions
21180: when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,
21181: according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so
21182: many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have
21183: about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to
21184: render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the
21185: sea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the
21186: becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
21187: exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable
21188: from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the
21189: chase of whales.
21190: 
21191: The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
21192: cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
21193: field.
21194: 
21195: “By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck
21196: creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two
21197: brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
21198: on the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
21199: that leaves no dust behind!”
21200: 
21201: “There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the
21202: mast-head cry.
21203: 
21204: “Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split
21205: your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
21206: trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller
21207: shuts his watergate upon the stream!”
21208: 
21209: And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies
21210: of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
21211: worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
21212: have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
21213: growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
21214: as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand
21215: of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the
21216: previous day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,
21217: unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
21218: towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
21219: along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
21220: vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
21221: that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.
21222: 
21223: They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
21224: though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,
21225: and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each
21226: other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced
21227: and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities
21228: of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,
21229: all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that
21230: fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
21231: 
21232: The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
21233: outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
21234: hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
21235: shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
21236: yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
21237: their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
21238: seek out the thing that might destroy them!
21239: 
21240: “Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after
21241: the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
21242: “Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd
21243: jet that way, and then disappears.”
21244: 
21245: It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
21246: other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
21247: hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
21248: pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the
21249: air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
21250: halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship
21251: than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick
21252: bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
21253: by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the
21254: White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous
21255: phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the
21256: furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the
21257: pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows
21258: his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,
21259: the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,
21260: this breaching is his act of defiance.
21261: 
21262: “There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his
21263: immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
21264: Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
21265: against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
21266: for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
21267: stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
21268: intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
21269: 
21270: “Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour
21271: and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
21272: fore. The boats!—stand by!”
21273: 
21274: Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
21275: shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
21276: halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
21277: from his perch.
21278: 
21279: “Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,
21280: rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep
21281: away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”
21282: 
21283: As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
21284: assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
21285: three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
21286: them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up
21287: to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
21288: such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong
21289: vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three
21290: boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale
21291: churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
21292: rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
21293: appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him
21294: from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
21295: of which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly
21296: wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while
21297: eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the
21298: time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
21299: 
21300: But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
21301: and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
21302: lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
21303: warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
21304: for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
21305: tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
21306: line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping
21307: that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage
21308: than the embattled teeth of sharks!
21309: 
21310: Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
21311: and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
21312: and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one
21313: thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
21314: within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line
21315: beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering
21316: the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into
21317: the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a
21318: sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so
21319: doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask
21320: towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a
21321: surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a
21322: boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
21323: the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
21324: stirred bowl of punch.
21325: 
21326: While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
21327: the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
21328: aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching
21329: his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was
21330: lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old
21331: man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
21332: rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
21333: concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
21334: Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
21335: from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its
21336: bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
21337: again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under
21338: it, like seals from a sea-side cave.
21339: 
21340: The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he
21341: struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
21342: distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
21343: back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
21344: side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or
21345: crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
21346: came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work
21347: for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
21348: ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
21349: leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.
21350: 
21351: As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
21352: came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
21353: floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
21354: and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,
21355: and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
21356: inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these
21357: were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen
21358: any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly
21359: clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy
21360: float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.
21361: 
21362: But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
21363: instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
21364: Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
21365: leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
21366: 
21367: “Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
21368: will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”
21369: 
21370: “The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
21371: put good work into that leg.”
21372: 
21373: “But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.
21374: 
21375: “Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a
21376: broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of
21377: mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,
21378: nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and
21379: inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
21380: yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”
21381: 
21382: “Dead to leeward, sir.”
21383: 
21384: “Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of
21385: the spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s
21386: crews.”
21387: 
21388: “Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”
21389: 
21390: “Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
21391: unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”
21392: 
21393: “Sir?”
21394: 
21395: “My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that
21396: shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
21397: By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”
21398: 
21399: The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
21400: Parsee was not there.
21401: 
21402: “The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”
21403: 
21404: “The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
21405: forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”
21406: 
21407: But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
21408: nowhere to be found.
21409: 
21410: “Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought
21411: I saw him dragging under.”
21412: 
21413: “_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What
21414: death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
21415: The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged
21416: iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did
21417: dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there! Keep him nailed—Quick!—all
21418: hands to the rigging of the boats—collect the oars—harpooneers! the
21419: irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a pull on all the
21420: sheets!—helm there! steady, steady for your life! I’ll ten times girdle
21421: the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I’ll slay
21422: him yet!”
21423: 
21424: “Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
21425: “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of
21426: this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
21427: to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
21428: shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more
21429: wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he
21430: swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the
21431: sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety
21432: and blasphemy to hunt him more!”
21433: 
21434: “Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
21435: hour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
21436: matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
21437: hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
21438: whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
21439: years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
21440: under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round
21441: me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
21442: lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but
21443: Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
21444: strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
21445: gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till
21446: ye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe
21447: ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!
21448: For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;
21449: then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s
21450: floated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but
21451: only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”
21452: 
21453: “As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.
21454: 
21455: “And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
21456: muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same
21457: to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
21458: to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
21459: Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was
21460: to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now
21461: might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of
21462: judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. _I’ll_, _I’ll_ solve it,
21463: though!”
21464: 
21465: When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
21466: 
21467: So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
21468: the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
21469: grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
21470: lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
21471: sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken
21472: keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while
21473: still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his
21474: scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its
21475: dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.
21476: 
21477: 
21478: CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.
21479: 
21480: The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
21481: solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
21482: daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
21483: 
21484: “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
21485: 
21486: “In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm
21487: there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
21488: again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
21489: angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
21490: fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had
21491: Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
21492: _that’s_ tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only
21493: has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness
21494: and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too
21495: much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very
21496: calm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the
21497: contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing
21498: now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like
21499: that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
21500: clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow
21501: it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
21502: tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this
21503: through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
21504: ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
21505: Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a
21506: wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink
21507: there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever
21508: conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run
21509: tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
21510: strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
21511: Even Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than _that_. Would now the
21512: wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and
21513: outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as
21514: objects, not as agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a
21515: most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that
21516: there’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm
21517: Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in
21518: strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,
21519: however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest
21520: Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go
21521: at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly
21522: blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them—something so
21523: unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it!
21524: Aloft there! What d’ye see?”
21525: 
21526: “Nothing, sir.”
21527: 
21528: “Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
21529: Aye, aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,
21530: he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I might have known it,
21531: too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him
21532: by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
21533: outs! Man the braces!”
21534: 
21535: Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s
21536: quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
21537: ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
21538: white wake.
21539: 
21540: “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
21541: himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God
21542: keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside
21543: wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”
21544: 
21545: “Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
21546: “We should meet him soon.”
21547: 
21548: “Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once
21549: more Ahab swung on high.
21550: 
21551: A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
21552: long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
21553: weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the
21554: three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had
21555: voiced it.
21556: 
21557: “Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
21558: there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far
21559: off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that
21560: helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
21561: let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s
21562: time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
21563: not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
21564: Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a
21565: soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead
21566: somewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the
21567: palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;
21568: the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old
21569: mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.
21570: No such green weather stains on Ahab’s head! There’s the difference now
21571: between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old
21572: together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a
21573: leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
21574: flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships
21575: made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital
21576: stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before
21577: me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at
21578: the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and
21579: all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,
21580: aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O
21581: Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep
21582: a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow,
21583: nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and
21584: tail.”
21585: 
21586: He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
21587: through the cloven blue air to the deck.
21588: 
21589: In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s
21590: stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
21591: mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.
21592: 
21593: “Starbuck!”
21594: 
21595: “Sir?”
21596: 
21597: “For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”
21598: 
21599: “Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”
21600: 
21601: “Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
21602: Starbuck!”
21603: 
21604: “Truth, sir: saddest truth.”
21605: 
21606: “Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
21607: flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,
21608: Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”
21609: 
21610: Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.
21611: 
21612: “Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a
21613: brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”
21614: 
21615: “Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by
21616: the crew!”
21617: 
21618: In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
21619: 
21620: “The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window
21621: there; “O master, my master, come back!”
21622: 
21623: But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
21624: boat leaped on.
21625: 
21626: Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
21627: numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
21628: the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time
21629: they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with
21630: their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats
21631: in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them
21632: in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of
21633: marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that
21634: had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first
21635: descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such
21636: tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the
21637: senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect
21638: them,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
21639: molesting the others.
21640: 
21641: “Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
21642: following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly
21643: to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by
21644: them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For
21645: when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be
21646: sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the
21647: evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God!
21648: what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
21649: expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,
21650: as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
21651: Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see
21652: but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
21653: clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs
21654: feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
21655: it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak
21656: aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
21657: there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the whale!—Ho!
21658: again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing
21659: to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with
21660: it!—Where’s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder,
21661: shudder!”
21662: 
21663: The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a
21664: downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but
21665: intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a
21666: little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the
21667: profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered
21668: against the opposing bow.
21669: 
21670: “Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
21671: drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
21672: no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”
21673: 
21674: Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
21675: quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
21676: swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
21677: subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
21678: trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
21679: but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,
21680: it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping
21681: back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
21682: an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
21683: flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
21684: marble trunk of the whale.
21685: 
21686: “Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
21687: the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in
21688: him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
21689: from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
21690: white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
21691: as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
21692: flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two
21693: mates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
21694: but leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.
21695: 
21696: While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
21697: whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
21698: shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round
21699: and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in
21700: which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of
21701: the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his
21702: sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old
21703: Ahab.
21704: 
21705: The harpoon dropped from his hand.
21706: 
21707: “Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see
21708: thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the
21709: hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of
21710: thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those
21711: boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;
21712: if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but
21713: offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
21714: not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the
21715: whale? gone down again?”
21716: 
21717: But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
21718: corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter
21719: had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again
21720: steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus
21721: far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the
21722: present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his
21723: utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight
21724: path in the sea.
21725: 
21726: “Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third
21727: day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that
21728: madly seekest him!”
21729: 
21730: Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
21731: to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding
21732: by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he
21733: leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and
21734: follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,
21735: he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
21736: mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
21737: which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
21738: repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he
21739: sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying
21740: themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all
21741: this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers
21742: seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking
21743: that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to
21744: Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another
21745: flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.
21746: 
21747: Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to
21748: his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
21749: latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
21750: Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
21751: nearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not
21752: been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves
21753: the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to
21754: the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades
21755: became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at
21756: almost every dip.
21757: 
21758: “Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull
21759: on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”
21760: 
21761: “But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”
21762: 
21763: “They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
21764: muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
21765: Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the
21766: helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
21767: to the bows of the still flying boat.
21768: 
21769: At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
21770: the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
21771: advance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the
21772: smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled
21773: round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
21774: with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
21775: poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
21776: hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
21777: into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
21778: nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so
21779: suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated
21780: part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have
21781: been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew
21782: not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for
21783: its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two
21784: of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a
21785: combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man
21786: helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.
21787: 
21788: Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
21789: instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
21790: sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
21791: the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
21792: seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
21793: felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
21794: 
21795: “What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!
21796: Burst in upon him!”
21797: 
21798: Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
21799: round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
21800: catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
21801: in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
21802: larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
21803: prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
21804: 
21805: Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!
21806: stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”
21807: 
21808: “The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.
21809: 
21810: “Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
21811: ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I
21812: see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”
21813: 
21814: But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
21815: sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
21816: burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
21817: lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,
21818: trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
21819: 
21820: Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer
21821: remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
21822: with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
21823: forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
21824: bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
21825: as he.
21826: 
21827: “The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of
21828: air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
21829: woman’s fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is
21830: this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
21831: Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
21832: helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
21833: towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me
21834: now!”
21835: 
21836: “Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
21837: help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
21838: whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own
21839: unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
21840: all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee,
21841: thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins
21842: of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would
21843: yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!
21844: thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
21845: not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his
21846: drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;—cherries!
21847: cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!”
21848: 
21849: “Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
21850: my poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
21851: now come to her, for the voyage is up.”
21852: 
21853: From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
21854: bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
21855: hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all
21856: their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side
21857: strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
21858: overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
21859: swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of
21860: all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
21861: smote the ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell
21862: flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
21863: harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,
21864: they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.
21865: 
21866: “The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;
21867: “its wood could only be American!”
21868: 
21869: Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
21870: keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
21871: off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a
21872: time, he lay quiescent.
21873: 
21874: “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
21875: hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
21876: and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and
21877: Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
21878: without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
21879: shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel
21880: my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your
21881: furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone
21882: life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,
21883: thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with
21884: thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last
21885: breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
21886: and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
21887: chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up
21888: the spear!”
21889: 
21890: The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
21891: velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
21892: clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
21893: neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
21894: shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
21895: heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty
21896: tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
21897: depths.
21898: 
21899: For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The
21900: ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering
21901: mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata
21902: Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
21903: infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
21904: pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
21905: And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
21906: crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
21907: animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
21908: smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
21909: 
21910: But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
21911: sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
21912: erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
21913: which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
21914: billows they almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
21915: hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the
21916: flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
21917: tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
21918: among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
21919: this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
21920: the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
21921: thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
21922: hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
21923: shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive
21924: form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
21925: Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
21926: heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
21927: 
21928: Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
21929: white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
21930: great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.

21936: 
21937: The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one
21938: did survive the wreck.
21939: 
21940: It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the
21941: Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman
21942: assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
21943: men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
21944: floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
21945: when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but
21946: slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
21947: subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
21948: towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
21949: wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that
21950: vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by
21951: reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
21952: with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,
21953: fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
21954: one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The
21955: unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;
21956: the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a
21957: sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the
21958: devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing
21959: children, only found another orphan.

22122:     • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
22123:         the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
22124:         you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

22126:         agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
22127:         Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

22162: effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
22163: works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
22164: Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
22165: electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
22166: contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
22167: or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

22190: received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
22191: with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

22205: warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
22206: damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
22207: violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
22208: agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
22209: limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
22210: unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
22211: remaining provisions.
22212:

22224: 
22225: Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
22226: 
22227: Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
22228: electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
22229: computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
22230: exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
22231: from people in all walks of life.
22232: 
22233: Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
22234: assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
22235: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
22236: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
22237: Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
22238: and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
22239: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
22240: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
22241: Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
22242: 
22243: Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
22244: 
22245: The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
22246: 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
22247: state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
22248: Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
22249: number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
22250: Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
22251: U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
22252: 
22253: The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
22254: Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
22255: to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website

22257: 
22258: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
22259: Literary Archive Foundation
22260: 
22261: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
22262: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
22263: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
22264: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
22265: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
22266: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
22267: status with the IRS.
22268: 
22269: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
22270: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
22271: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
22272: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
22273: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
22274: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
22275: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
22276: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
22277: 
22278: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
22279: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
22280: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
22281: approach us with offers to donate.
22282: 
22283: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
22284: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
22285: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
22286: 
22287: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
22288: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
22289: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
22290: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
22291: 
22292: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
22293: 
22294: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
22295: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
22296: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
22297: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
22298: volunteer support.
22299: 
22300: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
22301: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
22302: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
22303: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
22304: edition.
22305: 
22306: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
22307: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
22308: 
22309: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
22310: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
22311: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
22312: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
