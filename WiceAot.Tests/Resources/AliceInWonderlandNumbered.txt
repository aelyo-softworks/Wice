0053: CHAPTER I.
0054: Down the Rabbit-Hole
0055: 
0056: 
0057: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
0058: bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
0059: the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
0060: conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
0061: “without pictures or conversations?”
0062: 
0063: So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
0064: hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
0065: making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
0066: picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
0067: close by her.
0068: 
0069: There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
0070: so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
0071: dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
0072: it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
0073: time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
0074: watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
0075: on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
0076: had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
0077: watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
0078: field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
0079: large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
0080: 
0081: In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
0082: in the world she was to get out again.
0083: 
0084: The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
0085: dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
0086: about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
0087: deep well.
0088: 
0089: Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
0090: plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
0091: was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
0092: what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
0093: looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
0094: cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
0095: hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
0096: passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
0097: disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
0098: of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
0099: cupboards as she fell past it.
0100: 
0101: “Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
0102: think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
0103: at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
0104: top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)
0105: 
0106: Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how
0107: many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
0108: getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
0109: be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
0110: several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
0111: though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
0112: knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
0113: practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
0114: then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no
0115: idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
0116: grand words to say.)
0117: 
0118: Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
0119: the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
0120: with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
0121: glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
0122: the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
0123: country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”
0124: (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re
0125: falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what
0126: an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
0127: to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”
0128: 
0129: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
0130: talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”
0131: (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
0132: tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
0133: no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s
0134: very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here
0135: Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
0136: dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and
0137: sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer
0138: either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt
0139: that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
0140: walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
0141: “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,
0142: thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
0143: the fall was over.
0144: 
0145: Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
0146: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
0147: long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
0148: it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
0149: and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears
0150: and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she
0151: turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
0152: herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
0153: from the roof.
0154: 
0155: There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
0156: Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
0157: door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
0158: get out again.
0159: 
0160: Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
0161: glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s
0162: first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
0163: but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
0164: but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
0165: time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
0166: behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
0167: little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
0168: 
0169: Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
0170: much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
0171: passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
0172: out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
0173: flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
0174: through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought
0175: poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
0176: how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
0177: knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
0178: happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
0179: indeed were really impossible.
0180: 
0181: There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
0182: back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
0183: any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
0184: time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here
0185: before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
0186: label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large
0187: letters.
0188: 
0189: It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was
0190: not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,
0191: “and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read
0192: several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
0193: eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
0194: _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
0195: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
0196: and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
0197: bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
0198: bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,
0199: sooner or later.
0200: 
0201: However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to
0202: taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
0203: flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
0204: hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
0205: 
0206: *      *      *      *      *      *      *
0207: 
0208:     *      *      *      *      *      *
0209: 
0210: *      *      *      *      *      *      *
0211: 
0212: 
0213: “What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a
0214: telescope.”
0215: 
0216: And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
0217: brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
0218: through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
0219: waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
0220: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”
0221: said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
0222: wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the
0223: flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
0224: not remember ever having seen such a thing.
0225: 
0226: After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
0227: into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
0228: door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
0229: went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
0230: it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
0231: best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
0232: and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
0233: sat down and cried.
0234: 
0235: “Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,
0236: rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally
0237: gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
0238: and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
0239: her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
0240: cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
0241: for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
0242: “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two
0243: people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
0244: person!”
0245: 
0246: Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
0247: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
0248: “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said
0249: Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
0250: makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll
0251: get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”
0252: 
0253: She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which
0254: way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
0255: growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
0256: size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
0257: had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
0258: things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
0259: on in the common way.
0260: 
0261: So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
0262: 
0263: *      *      *      *      *      *      *

0268: 
0269: 
0270: 
0271: 
0272: CHAPTER II.
0273: The Pool of Tears
0274: 
0275: 
0276: “Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
0277: for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m
0278: opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”
0279: (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
0280: sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I
0281: wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m
0282: sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
0283: myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
0284: kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I
0285: want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
0286: Christmas.”
0287: 
0288: And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must
0289: go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending
0290: presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
0291: 
0292:      _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
0293:      Alice’s love_).
0294: 
0295: Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”
0296: 
0297: Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
0298: now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
0299: key and hurried off to the garden door.
0300: 
0301: Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
0302: look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
0303: hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
0304: 
0305: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like
0306: you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop
0307: this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding
0308: gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
0309: four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
0310: 
0311: After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
0312: she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
0313: Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
0314: in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
0315: great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the
0316: Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt
0317: so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
0318: Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,
0319: sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
0320: the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
0321: 
0322: Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
0323: kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How
0324: queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
0325: I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
0326: same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
0327: a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who
0328: in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began
0329: thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
0330: herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
0331: 
0332: “I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long
0333: ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t
0334: be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
0335: very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how
0336: puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
0337: Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
0338: and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
0339: rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try
0340: Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
0341: Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been
0342: changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she
0343: crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
0344: to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
0345: did not come the same as they used to do:—
0346: 
0347: “How doth the little crocodile
0348:     Improve his shining tail,
0349: And pour the waters of the Nile
0350:     On every golden scale!
0351: 
0352: “How cheerfully he seems to grin,
0353:     How neatly spread his claws,
0354: And welcome little fishes in
0355:     With gently smiling jaws!”
0356: 
0357: 
0358: “I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes
0359: filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and
0360: I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
0361: no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve
0362: made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be
0363: no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’
0364: I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
0365: then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down
0366: here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden
0367: burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
0368: _very_ tired of being all alone here!”
0369: 
0370: As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
0371: that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while
0372: she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be
0373: growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure
0374: herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
0375: now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
0376: found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
0377: dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
0378: 
0379: “That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
0380: sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and
0381: now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little
0382: door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
0383: key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than
0384: ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this
0385: before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”
0386: 
0387: As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
0388: splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
0389: she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by
0390: railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
0391: her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
0392: to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
0393: sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
0394: of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
0395: soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
0396: she was nine feet high.
0397: 
0398: “I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying
0399: to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
0400: being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
0401: sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”
0402: 
0403: Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
0404: off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
0405: it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
0406: she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
0407: slipped in like herself.
0408: 
0409: “Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
0410: Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
0411: likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she
0412: began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
0413: of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right
0414: way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
0415: she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of
0416: a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather
0417: inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
0418: but it said nothing.
0419: 
0420: “Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s
0421: a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all
0422: her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
0423: anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which
0424: was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
0425: sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
0426: fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
0427: had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like
0428: cats.”
0429: 
0430: “Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would
0431: _you_ like cats if you were me?”
0432: 
0433: “Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
0434: about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d
0435: take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
0436: quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
0437: in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
0438: paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
0439: nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
0440: pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
0441: over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk
0442: about her any more if you’d rather not.”
0443: 
0444: “We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
0445: tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
0446: _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name
0447: again!”
0448: 
0449: “I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
0450: conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not
0451: answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near
0452: our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
0453: know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when
0454: you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
0455: of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
0456: know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says
0457: it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
0458: “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away
0459: from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
0460: pool as it went.
0461: 
0462: So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
0463: won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the
0464: Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
0465: was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
0466: trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my
0467: history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”
0468: 
0469: It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
0470: birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
0471: Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
0472: led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
0473: 
0474: 
0475: 
0476: 
0477: CHAPTER III.
0478: A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
0479: 
0480: 
0481: They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the
0482: birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
0483: to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
0484: 
0485: The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
0486: consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
0487: natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
0488: she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
0489: with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am
0490: older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow
0491: without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
0492: tell its age, there was no more to be said.
0493: 
0494: At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
0495: called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make
0496: you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
0497: Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
0498: felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
0499: 
0500: “Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This
0501: is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William
0502: the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
0503: to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
0504: accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
0505: Mercia and Northumbria—’”
0506: 
0507: “Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.
0508: 
0509: “I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did
0510: you speak?”
0511: 
0512: “Not I!” said the Lory hastily.
0513: 
0514: “I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,
0515: the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
0516: Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”
0517: 
0518: “Found _what_?” said the Duck.
0519: 
0520: “Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know
0521: what ‘it’ means.”
0522: 
0523: “I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the
0524: Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
0525: archbishop find?”
0526: 
0527: The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found
0528: it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
0529: the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
0530: of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,
0531: turning to Alice as it spoke.
0532: 
0533: “As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to
0534: dry me at all.”
0535: 
0536: “In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move
0537: that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
0538: remedies—”
0539: 
0540: “Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half
0541: those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And
0542: the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
0543: tittered audibly.
0544: 
0545: “What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,
0546: that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
0547: 
0548: “What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to
0549: know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
0550: speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
0551: 
0552: “Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,
0553: as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
0554: tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
0555: 
0556: First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact
0557: shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed
0558: along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and
0559: away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
0560: liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
0561: when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
0562: again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all
0563: crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”
0564: 
0565: This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
0566: thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
0567: forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
0568: pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
0569: said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”
0570: 
0571: “But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.
0572: 
0573: “Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
0574: finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
0575: confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”
0576: 
0577: Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
0578: pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
0579: not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
0580: one a-piece, all round.
0581: 
0582: “But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.
0583: 
0584: “Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in
0585: your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.
0586: 
0587: “Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.
0588: 
0589: “Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.
0590: 
0591: Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
0592: presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant
0593: thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
0594: cheered.
0595: 
0596: Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
0597: that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
0598: to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
0599: she could.
0600: 
0601: The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
0602: confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
0603: theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
0604: However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
0605: begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
0606: 
0607: “You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why
0608: it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
0609: would be offended again.
0610: 
0611: “Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
0612: sighing.
0613: 
0614: “It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder
0615: at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on
0616: puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
0617: tale was something like this:—
0618: 
0619:          “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both
0620:          go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no
0621:          denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve
0622:          nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear
0623:          sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’
0624:          ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll
0625:          try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”
0626: 
0627: “You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are
0628: you thinking of?”
0629: 
0630: “I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth
0631: bend, I think?”
0632: 
0633: “I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
0634: 
0635: “A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
0636: anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”
0637: 
0638: “I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and
0639: walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”
0640: 
0641: “I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,
0642: you know!”
0643: 
0644: The Mouse only growled in reply.
0645: 
0646: “Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and
0647: the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only
0648: shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
0649: 
0650: “What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
0651: quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
0652: her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
0653: _your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little
0654: snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”
0655: 
0656: “I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,
0657: addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”
0658: 
0659: “And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the
0660: Lory.
0661: 
0662: Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
0663: “Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you
0664: can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
0665: she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”
0666: 
0667: This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
0668: birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
0669: carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air
0670: doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
0671: to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in
0672: bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
0673: alone.
0674: 
0675: “I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy
0676: tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best
0677: cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
0678: any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
0679: lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
0680: little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
0681: eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
0682: coming back to finish his story.
0683: 
0684: 
0685: 
0686: 
0687: CHAPTER IV.
0688: The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
0689: 
0690: 
0691: It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
0692: anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
0693: it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
0694: my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
0695: ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a
0696: moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
0697: gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
0698: they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
0699: her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
0700: little door, had vanished completely.
0701: 
0702: Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
0703: called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
0704: doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
0705: a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
0706: at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
0707: mistake it had made.
0708: 
0709: “He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How
0710: surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him
0711: his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she
0712: came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
0713: plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without
0714: knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
0715: real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
0716: fan and gloves.
0717: 
0718: “How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for
0719: a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she
0720: began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come
0721: here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,
0722: nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I
0723: don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
0724: if it began ordering people about like that!”
0725: 
0726: By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
0727: in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
0728: pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
0729: gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
0730: little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
0731: this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it
0732: and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to
0733: happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so
0734: I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large
0735: again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”
0736: 
0737: It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
0738: drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
0739: and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
0740: down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t
0741: grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t
0742: drunk quite so much!”
0743: 
0744: Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
0745: and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
0746: was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
0747: one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
0748: Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
0749: of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I
0750: can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”
0751: 
0752: Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
0753: and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
0754: seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
0755: again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
0756: 
0757: “It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t
0758: always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
0759: rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
0760: yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
0761: _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
0762: that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
0763: one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
0764: when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a
0765: sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”
0766: 
0767: “But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am
0768: now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but
0769: then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”
0770: 
0771: “Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn
0772: lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
0773: for any lesson-books!”
0774: 
0775: And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
0776: making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
0777: she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
0778: 
0779: “Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”
0780: Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
0781: the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
0782: house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
0783: large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
0784: 
0785: Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
0786: the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,
0787: that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll
0788: go round and get in at the window.”
0789: 
0790: “_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
0791: she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
0792: hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
0793: but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
0794: from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
0795: cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
0796: 
0797: Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And
0798: then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging
0799: for apples, yer honour!”
0800: 
0801: “Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and
0802: help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)
0803: 
0804: “Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”
0805: 
0806: “Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)
0807: 
0808: “An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
0809: window!”
0810: 
0811: “Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”
0812: 
0813: “Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”
0814: 
0815: There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
0816: now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at
0817: all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her
0818: hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
0819: _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number
0820: of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what
0821: they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
0822: _could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”
0823: 
0824: She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
0825: rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
0826: talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other
0827: ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!
0828: fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em
0829: together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do
0830: well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
0831: rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!
0832: Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I
0833: fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do
0834: it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says
0835: you’re to go down the chimney!”
0836: 
0837: “Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to
0838: herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in
0839: Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
0840: I _think_ I can kick a little!”
0841: 
0842: She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
0843: she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)
0844: scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
0845: saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited
0846: to see what would happen next.
0847: 
0848: The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”
0849: then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then
0850: silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy
0851: now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
0852: us all about it!”
0853: 
0854: Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought
0855: Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m
0856: a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me
0857: like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”
0858: 
0859: “So you did, old fellow!” said the others.
0860: 
0861: “We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice
0862: called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”
0863: 
0864: There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I
0865: wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the
0866: roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
0867: Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
0868: 
0869: “A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
0870: for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
0871: window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to
0872: this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that
0873: again!” which produced another dead silence.
0874: 
0875: Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
0876: little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
0877: head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make
0878: _some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it
0879: must make me smaller, I suppose.”
0880: 
0881: So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
0882: began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
0883: through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
0884: little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
0885: was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
0886: something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
0887: appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
0888: safe in a thick wood.
0889: 
0890: “The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she
0891: wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the
0892: second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
0893: will be the best plan.”
0894: 
0895: It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
0896: arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
0897: how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
0898: the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
0899: great hurry.
0900: 
0901: An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
0902: feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little
0903: thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
0904: it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
0905: might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
0906: spite of all her coaxing.
0907: 
0908: Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
0909: held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
0910: all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
0911: and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
0912: to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
0913: other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
0914: over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
0915: very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
0916: moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
0917: the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
0918: little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
0919: all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
0920: its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
0921: 
0922: This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
0923: set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
0924: and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
0925: 
0926: “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant
0927: against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
0928: leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d
0929: only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that
0930: I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I
0931: suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
0932: question is, what?”
0933: 
0934: The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
0935: the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
0936: looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
0937: There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
0938: herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
0939: behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
0940: was on the top of it.
0941: 
0942: She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
0943: mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
0944: caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
0945: smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
0946: anything else.
0947: 
0948: 
0949: 
0950: 
0951: CHAPTER V.
0952: Advice from a Caterpillar
0953: 
0954: 
0955: The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
0956: silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
0957: addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
0958: 
0959: “Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.
0960: 
0961: This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
0962: rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know
0963: who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
0964: changed several times since then.”
0965: 
0966: “What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain
0967: yourself!”
0968: 
0969: “I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m
0970: not myself, you see.”
0971: 
0972: “I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.
0973: 
0974: “I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,
0975: “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
0976: different sizes in a day is very confusing.”
0977: 
0978: “It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.
0979: 
0980: “Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you
0981: have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then
0982: after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little
0983: queer, won’t you?”
0984: 
0985: “Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.
0986: 
0987: “Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know
0988: is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”
0989: 
0990: “You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”
0991: 
0992: Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
0993: Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_
0994: short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I
0995: think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”
0996: 
0997: “Why?” said the Caterpillar.
0998: 
0999: Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
1000: good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
1001: state of mind, she turned away.
1002: 
1003: “Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something
1004: important to say!”
1005: 
1006: This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
1007: 
1008: “Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.
1009: 
1010: “Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
1011: could.
1012: 
1013: “No,” said the Caterpillar.
1014: 
1015: Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
1016: and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
1017: some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
1018: its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you
1019: think you’re changed, do you?”
1020: 
1021: “I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I
1022: used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”
1023: 
1024: “Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.
1025: 
1026: “Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all
1027: came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
1028: 
1029: “Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.
1030: 
1031: Alice folded her hands, and began:—
1032: 
1033: “You are old, Father William,” the young man said,
1034:     “And your hair has become very white;
1035: And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
1036:     Do you think, at your age, it is right?”
1037: 
1038: “In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
1039:     “I feared it might injure the brain;
1040: But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
1041:     Why, I do it again and again.”
1042: 
1043: “You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
1044:     And have grown most uncommonly fat;
1045: Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
1046:     Pray, what is the reason of that?”
1047: 
1048: “In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
1049:     “I kept all my limbs very supple
1050: By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
1051:     Allow me to sell you a couple?”
1052: 
1053: “You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
1054:     For anything tougher than suet;
1055: Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
1056:     Pray, how did you manage to do it?”
1057: 
1058: “In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
1059:     And argued each case with my wife;
1060: And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
1061:     Has lasted the rest of my life.”
1062: 
1063: “You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose
1064:     That your eye was as steady as ever;
1065: Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
1066:     What made you so awfully clever?”
1067: 
1068: “I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
1069:     Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!
1070: Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
1071:     Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”
1072: 
1073: 
1074: “That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.
1075: 
1076: “Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the
1077: words have got altered.”
1078: 
1079: “It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,
1080: and there was silence for some minutes.
1081: 
1082: The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
1083: 
1084: “What size do you want to be?” it asked.
1085: 
1086: “Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one
1087: doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”
1088: 
1089: “I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.
1090: 
1091: Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
1092: before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
1093: 
1094: “Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.
1095: 
1096: “Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t
1097: mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”
1098: 
1099: “It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,
1100: rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
1101: 
1102: “But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
1103: thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily
1104: offended!”
1105: 
1106: “You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the
1107: hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
1108: 
1109: This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
1110: minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
1111: yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
1112: mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
1113: “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
1114: grow shorter.”
1115: 
1116: “One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to
1117: herself.
1118: 
1119: “Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
1120: aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
1121: 
1122: Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
1123: trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
1124: perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
1125: last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
1126: off a bit of the edge with each hand.
1127: 
1128: “And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
1129: the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
1130: violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
1131: 
1132: She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
1133: that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
1134: set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
1135: so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
1136: mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
1137: lefthand bit.
1138: 
1139: *      *      *      *      *      *      *
1140: 
1141:     *      *      *      *      *      *
1142: 
1143: *      *      *      *      *      *      *
1144: 
1145: 
1146: “Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which
1147: changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
1148: were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
1149: an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
1150: sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
1151: 
1152: “What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my
1153: shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”
1154: She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
1155: except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
1156: 
1157: As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
1158: she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
1159: her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
1160: had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
1161: going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
1162: the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
1163: hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
1164: face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
1165: 
1166: “Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.
1167: 
1168: “I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”
1169: 
1170: “Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
1171: tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing
1172: seems to suit them!”
1173: 
1174: “I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.
1175: 
1176: “I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried
1177: hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those
1178: serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”
1179: 
1180: Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
1181: saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
1182: 
1183: “As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;
1184: “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
1185: haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”
1186: 
1187: “I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to
1188: see its meaning.
1189: 
1190: “And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the
1191: Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I
1192: should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
1193: from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”
1194: 
1195: “But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”
1196: 
1197: “Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to
1198: invent something!”
1199: 
1200: “I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
1201: the number of changes she had gone through that day.
1202: 
1203: “A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
1204: contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
1205: _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s
1206: no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never
1207: tasted an egg!”
1208: 
1209: “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful
1210: child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
1211: know.”
1212: 
1213: “I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then
1214: they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”
1215: 
1216: This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
1217: minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re
1218: looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
1219: me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”
1220: 
1221: “It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not
1222: looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want
1223: _yours_: I don’t like them raw.”
1224: 
1225: “Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
1226: down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
1227: as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
1228: and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
1229: she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
1230: and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
1231: the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
1232: she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
1233: 
1234: It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
1235: felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
1236: and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan
1237: done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m
1238: going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my
1239: right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
1240: _is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly
1241: upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
1242: “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them
1243: _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she
1244: began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
1245: near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
1246: 
1247: 
1248: 
1249: 
1250: CHAPTER VI.
1251: Pig and Pepper
1252: 
1253: 
1254: For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
1255: to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
1256: wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
1257: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
1258: fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
1259: another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
1260: frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
1261: all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
1262: about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
1263: 
1264: The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
1265: nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
1266: saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the
1267: Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
1268: tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.
1269: An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”
1270: 
1271: Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
1272: 
1273: Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
1274: for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
1275: Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
1276: door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
1277: 
1278: Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
1279: 
1280: “There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for
1281: two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you
1282: are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could
1283: possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
1284: noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
1285: and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
1286: pieces.
1287: 
1288: “Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”
1289: 
1290: “There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on
1291: without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,
1292: if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
1293: know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
1294: this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”
1295: she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
1296: head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”
1297: she repeated, aloud.
1298: 
1299: “I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”
1300: 
1301: At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
1302: skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,
1303: and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
1304: 
1305: “—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
1306: as if nothing had happened.
1307: 
1308: “How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
1309: 
1310: “_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first
1311: question, you know.”
1312: 
1313: It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really
1314: dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.
1315: It’s enough to drive one crazy!”
1316: 
1317: The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
1318: remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for
1319: days and days.”
1320: 
1321: “But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.
1322: 
1323: “Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.
1324: 
1325: “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s
1326: perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.
1327: 
1328: The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
1329: one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
1330: in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
1331: stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
1332: 
1333: “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to
1334: herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
1335: 
1336: There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
1337: occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
1338: alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen
1339: that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
1340: on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
1341: 
1342: “Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
1343: not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why
1344: your cat grins like that?”
1345: 
1346: “It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”
1347: 
1348: She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
1349: jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
1350: baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—
1351: 
1352: “I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t
1353: know that cats _could_ grin.”
1354: 
1355: “They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”
1356: 
1357: “I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite
1358: pleased to have got into a conversation.
1359: 
1360: “You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”
1361: 
1362: Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
1363: be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
1364: was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
1365: fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
1366: the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a
1367: shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
1368: them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
1369: that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
1370: 
1371: “Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down
1372: in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an
1373: unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
1374: off.
1375: 
1376: “If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse
1377: growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”
1378: 
1379: “Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to
1380: get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just
1381: think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
1382: earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”
1383: 
1384: “Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”
1385: 
1386: Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
1387: the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
1388: be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or
1389: is it twelve? I—”
1390: 
1391: “Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide
1392: figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
1393: sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
1394: the end of every line:
1395: 
1396: “Speak roughly to your little boy,
1397:     And beat him when he sneezes:
1398: He only does it to annoy,
1399:     Because he knows it teases.”
1400: 
1401: 
1402: CHORUS.
1403: (In which the cook and the baby joined):
1404: 
1405: 
1406: “Wow! wow! wow!”
1407: 
1408: 
1409: While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
1410: the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
1411: that Alice could hardly hear the words:—
1412: 
1413: “I speak severely to my boy,
1414:     I beat him when he sneezes;
1415: For he can thoroughly enjoy
1416:     The pepper when he pleases!”
1417: 
1418: 
1419: CHORUS.
1420: 
1421: 
1422: “Wow! wow! wow!”
1423: 
1424: 
1425: “Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,
1426: flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play
1427: croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook
1428: threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
1429: 
1430: Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
1431: little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
1432: “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was
1433: snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
1434: itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
1435: the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
1436: 
1437: As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
1438: twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
1439: ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
1440: out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”
1441: thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
1442: murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the
1443: little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
1444: “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of
1445: expressing yourself.”
1446: 
1447: The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
1448: to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
1449: a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
1450: its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
1451: not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only
1452: sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
1453: were any tears.
1454: 
1455: No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”
1456: said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
1457: now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
1458: to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
1459: 
1460: Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do
1461: with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so
1462: violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
1463: there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
1464: a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
1465: further.
1466: 
1467: So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
1468: trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to
1469: herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
1470: rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other
1471: children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
1472: to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she
1473: was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
1474: a tree a few yards off.
1475: 
1476: The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
1477: thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
1478: felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
1479: 
1480: “Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
1481: whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
1482: wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.
1483: “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
1484: 
1485: “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
1486: 
1487: “I don’t much care where—” said Alice.
1488: 
1489: “Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
1490: 
1491: “—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.
1492: 
1493: “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long
1494: enough.”
1495: 
1496: Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
1497: question. “What sort of people live about here?”
1498: 
1499: “In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives
1500: a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a
1501: March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”
1502: 
1503: “But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.
1504: 
1505: “Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.
1506: You’re mad.”
1507: 
1508: “How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.
1509: 
1510: “You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”
1511: 
1512: Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how
1513: do you know that you’re mad?”
1514: 
1515: “To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”
1516: 
1517: “I suppose so,” said Alice.
1518: 
1519: “Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,
1520: and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,
1521: and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”
1522: 
1523: “_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.
1524: 
1525: “Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the
1526: Queen to-day?”
1527: 
1528: “I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited
1529: yet.”
1530: 
1531: “You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.
1532: 
1533: Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
1534: things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
1535: it suddenly appeared again.
1536: 
1537: “By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly
1538: forgotten to ask.”
1539: 
1540: “It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
1541: in a natural way.
1542: 
1543: “I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.
1544: 
1545: Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
1546: appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
1547: which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she
1548: said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
1549: perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it
1550: was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
1551: again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
1552: 
1553: “Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.
1554: 
1555: “I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing
1556: and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”
1557: 
1558: “All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
1559: beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
1560: remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
1561: 
1562: “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a
1563: grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”
1564: 
1565: She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
1566: the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
1567: chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
1568: was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
1569: nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
1570: to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
1571: timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
1572: I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”
1573: 
1574: 
1575: 
1576: 
1577: CHAPTER VII.
1578: A Mad Tea-Party
1579: 
1580: 
1581: There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
1582: March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
1583: between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
1584: cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very
1585: uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,
1586: I suppose it doesn’t mind.”
1587: 
1588: The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
1589: one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw
1590: Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and
1591: she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
1592: 
1593: “Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
1594: 
1595: Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
1596: “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.
1597: 
1598: “There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.
1599: 
1600: “Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.
1601: 
1602: “It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said
1603: the March Hare.
1604: 
1605: “I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great
1606: many more than three.”
1607: 
1608: “Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at
1609: Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
1610: speech.
1611: 
1612: “You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some
1613: severity; “it’s very rude.”
1614: 
1615: The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
1616: was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
1617: 
1618: “Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve
1619: begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.
1620: 
1621: “Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said
1622: the March Hare.
1623: 
1624: “Exactly so,” said Alice.
1625: 
1626: “Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.
1627: 
1628: “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I
1629: say—that’s the same thing, you know.”
1630: 
1631: “Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well
1632: say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
1633: 
1634: “You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what
1635: I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”
1636: 
1637: “You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
1638: talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing
1639: as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”
1640: 
1641: “It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the
1642: conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
1643: Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
1644: writing-desks, which wasn’t much.
1645: 
1646: The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month
1647: is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
1648: pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
1649: and holding it to his ear.
1650: 
1651: Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”
1652: 
1653: “Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit
1654: the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
1655: 
1656: “It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.
1657: 
1658: “Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:
1659: “you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”
1660: 
1661: The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
1662: it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
1663: nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,
1664: you know.”
1665: 
1666: Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a
1667: funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t
1668: tell what o’clock it is!”
1669: 
1670: “Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what
1671: year it is?”
1672: 
1673: “Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it
1674: stays the same year for such a long time together.”
1675: 
1676: “Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.
1677: 
1678: Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no
1679: sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite
1680: understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.
1681: 
1682: “The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little
1683: hot tea upon its nose.
1684: 
1685: The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
1686: eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”
1687: 
1688: “Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice
1689: again.
1690: 
1691: “No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”
1692: 
1693: “I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.
1694: 
1695: “Nor I,” said the March Hare.
1696: 
1697: Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the
1698: time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no
1699: answers.”
1700: 
1701: “If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk
1702: about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”
1703: 
1704: “I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.
1705: 
1706: “Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head
1707: contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”
1708: 
1709: “Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat
1710: time when I learn music.”
1711: 
1712: “Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.
1713: Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything
1714: you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in
1715: the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a
1716: hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
1717: time for dinner!”
1718: 
1719: (“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
1720: 
1721: “That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I
1722: shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”
1723: 
1724: “Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to
1725: half-past one as long as you liked.”
1726: 
1727: “Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.
1728: 
1729: The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We
1730: quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing
1731: with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert
1732: given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
1733: 
1734: ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
1735: How I wonder what you’re at!’
1736: 
1737: 
1738: You know the song, perhaps?”
1739: 
1740: “I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.
1741: 
1742: “It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—
1743: 
1744: ‘Up above the world you fly,
1745: Like a tea-tray in the sky.
1746:                     Twinkle, twinkle—’”
1747: 
1748: 
1749: Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
1750: “_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they
1751: had to pinch it to make it stop.
1752: 
1753: “Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the
1754: Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his
1755: head!’”
1756: 
1757: “How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.
1758: 
1759: “And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t
1760: do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”
1761: 
1762: A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many
1763: tea-things are put out here?” she asked.
1764: 
1765: “Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,
1766: and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”
1767: 
1768: “Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.
1769: 
1770: “Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”
1771: 
1772: “But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured
1773: to ask.
1774: 
1775: “Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
1776: “I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”
1777: 
1778: “I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the
1779: proposal.
1780: 
1781: “Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And
1782: they pinched it on both sides at once.
1783: 
1784: The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a
1785: hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”
1786: 
1787: “Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.
1788: 
1789: “Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.
1790: 
1791: “And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again
1792: before it’s done.”
1793: 
1794: “Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began
1795: in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
1796: they lived at the bottom of a well—”
1797: 
1798: “What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest
1799: in questions of eating and drinking.
1800: 
1801: “They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
1802: two.
1803: 
1804: “They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;
1805: “they’d have been ill.”
1806: 
1807: “So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”
1808: 
1809: Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of
1810: living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But
1811: why did they live at the bottom of a well?”
1812: 
1813: “Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
1814: 
1815: “I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t
1816: take more.”
1817: 
1818: “You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to
1819: take _more_ than nothing.”
1820: 
1821: “Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.
1822: 
1823: “Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.
1824: 
1825: Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
1826: some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
1827: repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”
1828: 
1829: The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
1830: said, “It was a treacle-well.”
1831: 
1832: “There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
1833: Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily
1834: remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for
1835: yourself.”
1836: 
1837: “No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I
1838: dare say there may be _one_.”
1839: 
1840: “One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
1841: go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,
1842: you know—”
1843: 
1844: “What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
1845: 
1846: “Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
1847: 
1848: “I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place
1849: on.”
1850: 
1851: He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
1852: moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
1853: place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
1854: advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
1855: before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
1856: 
1857: Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
1858: cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
1859: from?”
1860: 
1861: “You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should
1862: think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”
1863: 
1864: “But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
1865: to notice this last remark.
1866: 
1867: “Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”
1868: 
1869: This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
1870: some time without interrupting it.
1871: 
1872: “They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
1873: its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of
1874: things—everything that begins with an M—”
1875: 
1876: “Why with an M?” said Alice.
1877: 
1878: “Why not?” said the March Hare.
1879: 
1880: Alice was silent.
1881: 
1882: The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
1883: doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
1884: little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as
1885: mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
1886: things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a
1887: drawing of a muchness?”
1888: 
1889: “Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t
1890: think—”
1891: 
1892: “Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.
1893: 
1894: This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
1895: great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
1896: neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
1897: looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
1898: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
1899: the teapot.
1900: 
1901: “At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her
1902: way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
1903: all my life!”
1904: 
1905: Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
1906: leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But
1907: everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And
1908: in she went.
1909: 
1910: Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
1911: glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,
1912: and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
1913: led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
1914: (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
1915: high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found
1916: herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
1917: and the cool fountains.
1918: 
1919: 
1920: 
1921: 
1922: CHAPTER VIII.
1923: The Queen’s Croquet-Ground
1924: 
1925: 
1926: A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
1927: growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
1928: painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
1929: went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
1930: one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me
1931: like that!”
1932: 
1933: “I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my
1934: elbow.”
1935: 
1936: On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the
1937: blame on others!”
1938: 
1939: “_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only
1940: yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”
1941: 
1942: “What for?” said the one who had spoken first.
1943: 
1944: “That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.
1945: 
1946: “Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for
1947: bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”
1948: 
1949: Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust
1950: things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
1951: them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
1952: and all of them bowed low.
1953: 
1954: “Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are
1955: painting those roses?”
1956: 
1957: Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
1958: voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
1959: _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
1960: was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
1961: you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this
1962: moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
1963: out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw
1964: themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
1965: and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
1966: 
1967: First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
1968: three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
1969: corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
1970: diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
1971: the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
1972: jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
1973: ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
1974: and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
1975: hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
1976: by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
1977: the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
1978: grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
1979: 
1980: Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
1981: like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
1982: of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a
1983: procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their
1984: faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,
1985: and waited.
1986: 
1987: When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
1988: at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the
1989: Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
1990: 
1991: “Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
1992: Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”
1993: 
1994: “My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;
1995: but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after
1996: all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”
1997: 
1998: “And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
1999: who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
2000: their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
2001: the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
2002: or courtiers, or three of her own children.
2003: 
2004: “How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s
2005: no business of _mine_.”
2006: 
2007: The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
2008: moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”
2009: 
2010: “Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
2011: silent.
2012: 
2013: The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my
2014: dear: she is only a child!”
2015: 
2016: The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn
2017: them over!”
2018: 
2019: The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
2020: 
2021: “Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
2022: gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
2023: the royal children, and everybody else.
2024: 
2025: “Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,
2026: turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing
2027: here?”
2028: 
2029: “May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going
2030: down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”
2031: 
2032: “_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
2033: “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the
2034: soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
2035: to Alice for protection.
2036: 
2037: “You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large
2038: flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
2039: minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
2040: others.
2041: 
2042: “Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.
2043: 
2044: “Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted
2045: in reply.
2046: 
2047: “That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”
2048: 
2049: The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
2050: evidently meant for her.
2051: 
2052: “Yes!” shouted Alice.
2053: 
2054: “Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
2055: wondering very much what would happen next.
2056: 
2057: “It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was
2058: walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
2059: 
2060: “Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”
2061: 
2062: “Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
2063: anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
2064: tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under
2065: sentence of execution.”
2066: 
2067: “What for?” said Alice.
2068: 
2069: “Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.
2070: 
2071: “No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
2072: ‘What for?’”
2073: 
2074: “She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
2075: scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
2076: tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
2077: Queen said—”
2078: 
2079: “Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
2080: people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
2081: other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
2082: began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
2083: in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
2084: hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
2085: themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
2086: 
2087: The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
2088: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
2089: under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
2090: had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
2091: hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
2092: up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
2093: bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
2094: going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
2095: had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
2096: this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
2097: wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
2098: always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
2099: soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
2100: 
2101: The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
2102: all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
2103: the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
2104: shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a
2105: minute.
2106: 
2107: Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
2108: dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
2109: “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully
2110: fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any
2111: one left alive!”
2112: 
2113: She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
2114: could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
2115: appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
2116: watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
2117: to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
2118: to.”
2119: 
2120: “How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
2121: enough for it to speak with.
2122: 
2123: Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
2124: speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one
2125: of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
2126: down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
2127: she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
2128: was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
2129: 
2130: “I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a
2131: complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
2132: oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at
2133: least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how
2134: confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the
2135: arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
2136: ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only
2137: it ran away when it saw mine coming!”
2138: 
2139: “How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.
2140: 
2141: “Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed
2142: that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
2143: “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”
2144: 
2145: The Queen smiled and passed on.
2146: 
2147: “Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
2148: looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.
2149: 
2150: “It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
2151: introduce it.”
2152: 
2153: “I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may
2154: kiss my hand if it likes.”
2155: 
2156: “I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.
2157: 
2158: “Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like
2159: that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.
2160: 
2161: “A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
2162: but I don’t remember where.”
2163: 
2164: “Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called
2165: the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would
2166: have this cat removed!”
2167: 
2168: The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
2169: small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.
2170: 
2171: “I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he
2172: hurried off.
2173: 
2174: Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
2175: on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with
2176: passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
2177: executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
2178: of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
2179: whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
2180: 
2181: The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
2182: to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
2183: other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
2184: the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
2185: helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
2186: 
2187: By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
2188: was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t
2189: matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side
2190: of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
2191: escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
2192: friend.
2193: 
2194: When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
2195: a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
2196: the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
2197: while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
2198: 
2199: The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
2200: the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
2201: all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
2202: what they said.
2203: 
2204: The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless
2205: there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
2206: thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.
2207: 
2208: The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
2209: beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.
2210: 
2211: The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in
2212: less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
2213: this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
2214: anxious.)
2215: 
2216: Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the
2217: Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”
2218: 
2219: “She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”
2220: And the executioner went off like an arrow.
2221: 
2222: The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
2223: time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
2224: the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
2225: while the rest of the party went back to the game.
2226: 
2227: 
2228: 
2229: 
2230: CHAPTER IX.
2231: The Mock Turtle’s Story
2232: 
2233: 
2234: “You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”
2235: said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,
2236: and they walked off together.
2237: 
2238: Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
2239: to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
2240: savage when they met in the kitchen.
2241: 
2242: “When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
2243: tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
2244: does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people
2245: hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
2246: kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
2247: them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
2248: sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be
2249: so stingy about it, you know—”
2250: 
2251: She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
2252: startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking
2253: about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
2254: tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
2255: a bit.”
2256: 
2257: “Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.
2258: 
2259: “Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only
2260: you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as
2261: she spoke.
2262: 
2263: Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
2264: Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
2265: right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an
2266: uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
2267: bore it as well as she could.
2268: 
2269: “The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up
2270: the conversation a little.
2271: 
2272: “’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
2273: ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”
2274: 
2275: “Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding
2276: their own business!”
2277: 
2278: “Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her
2279: sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of
2280: _that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
2281: themselves.’”
2282: 
2283: “How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to
2284: herself.
2285: 
2286: “I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”
2287: the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about
2288: the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”
2289: 
2290: “He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
2291: to have the experiment tried.
2292: 
2293: “Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
2294: the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”
2295: 
2296: “Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.
2297: 
2298: “Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of
2299: putting things!”
2300: 
2301: “It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.
2302: 
2303: “Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
2304: everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.
2305: And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is
2306: of yours.’”
2307: 
2308: “Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
2309: remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”
2310: 
2311: “I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that
2312: is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more
2313: simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
2314: appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
2315: otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
2316: otherwise.’”
2317: 
2318: “I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,
2319: “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”
2320: 
2321: “That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,
2322: in a pleased tone.
2323: 
2324: “Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said
2325: Alice.
2326: 
2327: “Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present
2328: of everything I’ve said as yet.”
2329: 
2330: “A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give
2331: birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out
2332: loud.
2333: 
2334: “Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
2335: little chin.
2336: 
2337: “I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
2338: feel a little worried.
2339: 
2340: “Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and
2341: the m—”
2342: 
2343: But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,
2344: even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was
2345: linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
2346: Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
2347: thunderstorm.
2348: 
2349: “A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
2350: 
2351: “Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the
2352: ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in
2353: about half no time! Take your choice!”
2354: 
2355: The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
2356: 
2357: “Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
2358: much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
2359: croquet-ground.
2360: 
2361: The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were
2362: resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
2363: back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay
2364: would cost them their lives.
2365: 
2366: All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
2367: with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with
2368: her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
2369: soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
2370: that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
2371: all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
2372: and under sentence of execution.
2373: 
2374: Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have
2375: you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”
2376: 
2377: “No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”
2378: 
2379: “It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.
2380: 
2381: “I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.
2382: 
2383: “Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.”
2384: 
2385: As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
2386: to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a
2387: good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
2388: number of executions the Queen had ordered.
2389: 
2390: They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
2391: you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy
2392: thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock
2393: Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
2394: executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
2395: with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
2396: but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
2397: as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
2398: 
2399: The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
2400: she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,
2401: half to itself, half to Alice.
2402: 
2403: “What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.
2404: 
2405: “Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never
2406: executes nobody, you know. Come on!”
2407: 
2408: “Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly
2409: after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”
2410: 
2411: They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
2412: sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
2413: nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
2414: pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the
2415: Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all
2416: his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”
2417: 
2418: So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
2419: full of tears, but said nothing.
2420: 
2421: “This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your
2422: history, she do.”
2423: 
2424: “I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit
2425: down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”
2426: 
2427: So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
2428: herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”
2429: But she waited patiently.
2430: 
2431: “Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real
2432: Turtle.”
2433: 
2434: These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
2435: occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant
2436: heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
2437: saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not
2438: help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
2439: nothing.
2440: 
2441: “When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
2442: though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the
2443: sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”
2444: 
2445: “Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.
2446: 
2447: “We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle
2448: angrily: “really you are very dull!”
2449: 
2450: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
2451: question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
2452: at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
2453: Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all
2454: day about it!” and he went on in these words:
2455: 
2456: “Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”
2457: 
2458: “I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.
2459: 
2460: “You did,” said the Mock Turtle.
2461: 
2462: “Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
2463: The Mock Turtle went on.
2464: 
2465: “We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”
2466: 
2467: “_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so
2468: proud as all that.”
2469: 
2470: “With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
2471: 
2472: “Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”
2473: 
2474: “And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.
2475: 
2476: “Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.
2477: 
2478: “Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a
2479: tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
2480: ‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”
2481: 
2482: “You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom
2483: of the sea.”
2484: 
2485: “I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I
2486: only took the regular course.”
2487: 
2488: “What was that?” inquired Alice.
2489: 
2490: “Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle
2491: replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
2492: Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”
2493: 
2494: “I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”
2495: 
2496: The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of
2497: uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”
2498: 
2499: “Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”
2500: 
2501: “Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify
2502: is, you _are_ a simpleton.”
2503: 
2504: Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
2505: she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”
2506: 
2507: “Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
2508: subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
2509: Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
2510: that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
2511: Fainting in Coils.”
2512: 
2513: “What was _that_ like?” said Alice.
2514: 
2515: “Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too
2516: stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”
2517: 
2518: “Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,
2519: though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”
2520: 
2521: “I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught
2522: Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”
2523: 
2524: “So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
2525: creatures hid their faces in their paws.
2526: 
2527: “And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry
2528: to change the subject.
2529: 
2530: “Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so
2531: on.”
2532: 
2533: “What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.
2534: 
2535: “That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:
2536: “because they lessen from day to day.”
2537: 
2538: This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
2539: before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been
2540: a holiday?”
2541: 
2542: “Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.
2543: 
2544: “And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.
2545: 
2546: “That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very
2547: decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”
2548: 
2549: 
2550: 
2551: 
2552: CHAPTER X.
2553: The Lobster Quadrille
2554: 
2555: 
2556: The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
2557: his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
2558: two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”
2559: said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
2560: the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
2561: running down his cheeks, he went on again:—
2562: 
2563: “You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said
2564: Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”
2565: (Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and
2566: said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
2567: Lobster Quadrille is!”
2568: 
2569: “No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”
2570: 
2571: “Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the
2572: sea-shore—”
2573: 
2574: “Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
2575: then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”
2576: 
2577: “_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.
2578: 
2579: “—you advance twice—”
2580: 
2581: “Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.
2582: 
2583: “Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”
2584: 
2585: “—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.
2586: 
2587: “Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”
2588: 
2589: “The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
2590: 
2591: “—as far out to sea as you can—”
2592: 
2593: “Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.
2594: 
2595: “Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
2596: about.
2597: 
2598: “Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
2599: 
2600: “Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock
2601: Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
2602: been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
2603: sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
2604: 
2605: “It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.
2606: 
2607: “Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.
2608: 
2609: “Very much indeed,” said Alice.
2610: 
2611: “Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the
2612: Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”
2613: 
2614: “Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”
2615: 
2616: So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
2617: then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
2618: forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
2619: and sadly:—
2620: 
2621: “Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
2622: “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
2623: See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
2624: They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
2625: Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
2626: Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?
2627: 
2628: “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
2629: When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
2630: But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
2631: Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
2632: Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
2633: Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
2634: 
2635: “What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
2636: “There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
2637: The further off from England the nearer is to France—
2638: Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
2639: Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
2640: Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”
2641: 
2642: 
2643: “Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,
2644: feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that
2645: curious song about the whiting!”
2646: 
2647: “Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,
2648: of course?”
2649: 
2650: “Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself
2651: hastily.
2652: 
2653: “I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve
2654: seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”
2655: 
2656: “I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in
2657: their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”
2658: 
2659: “You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would
2660: all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
2661: and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
2662: eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.
2663: 
2664: “The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the
2665: lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
2666: fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
2667: couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”
2668: 
2669: “Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much
2670: about a whiting before.”
2671: 
2672: “I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you
2673: know why it’s called a whiting?”
2674: 
2675: “I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”
2676: 
2677: “_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
2678: 
2679: Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated
2680: in a wondering tone.
2681: 
2682: “Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what
2683: makes them so shiny?”
2684: 
2685: Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
2686: answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”
2687: 
2688: “Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
2689: “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”
2690: 
2691: “And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
2692: 
2693: “Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
2694: “any shrimp could have told you that.”
2695: 
2696: “If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still
2697: running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,
2698: please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”
2699: 
2700: “They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no
2701: wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”
2702: 
2703: “Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
2704: 
2705: “Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,
2706: and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”
2707: 
2708: “Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.
2709: 
2710: “I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
2711: the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”
2712: 
2713: “I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said
2714: Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,
2715: because I was a different person then.”
2716: 
2717: “Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.
2718: 
2719: “No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
2720: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”
2721: 
2722: So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
2723: saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
2724: the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
2725: their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
2726: went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
2727: about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the
2728: Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
2729: Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”
2730: 
2731: “It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.
2732: 
2733: “It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I
2734: should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
2735: begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
2736: authority over Alice.
2737: 
2738: “Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the
2739: Gryphon.
2740: 
2741: “How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”
2742: thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got
2743: up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
2744: Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
2745: very queer indeed:—
2746: 
2747: “’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
2748: “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
2749: As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
2750: Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”
2751: 
2752: [later editions continued as follows
2753: When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
2754: And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
2755: But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
2756: His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
2757: 
2758: 
2759: “That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said
2760: the Gryphon.
2761: 
2762: “Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds
2763: uncommon nonsense.”
2764: 
2765: Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
2766: wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.
2767: 
2768: “I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.
2769: 
2770: “She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next
2771: verse.”
2772: 
2773: “But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn
2774: them out with his nose, you know?”
2775: 
2776: “It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully
2777: puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
2778: 
2779: “Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it
2780: begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”
2781: 
2782: Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
2783: wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—
2784: 
2785: “I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
2786: How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”
2787: 
2788: [later editions continued as follows
2789: The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
2790: While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
2791: When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
2792: Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
2793: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
2794: And concluded the banquet—]
2795: 
2796: 
2797: “What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle
2798: interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the
2799: most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”
2800: 
2801: “Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was
2802: only too glad to do so.
2803: 
2804: “Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon
2805: went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”
2806: 
2807: “Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice
2808: replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
2809: “Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old
2810: fellow?”
2811: 
2812: The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
2813: with sobs, to sing this:—
2814: 
2815: “Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
2816: Waiting in a hot tureen!
2817: Who for such dainties would not stoop?
2818: Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2819: Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2820:     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
2821:     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
2822: Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
2823:     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
2824: 
2825: “Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
2826: Game, or any other dish?
2827: Who would not give all else for two p
2828: ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2829: Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2830:     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
2831:     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
2832: Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
2833:     Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”
2834: 
2835: 
2836: “Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
2837: to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the
2838: distance.
2839: 
2840: “Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
2841: off, without waiting for the end of the song.
2842: 
2843: “What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
2844: answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
2845: came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—
2846: 
2847: “Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
2848:     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”
2849: 
2850: 
2851: 
2852: 
2853: CHAPTER XI.
2854: Who Stole the Tarts?
2855: 
2856: 
2857: The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
2858: arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little
2859: birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
2860: standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
2861: him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
2862: hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
2863: court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
2864: good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d
2865: get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”
2866: But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
2867: everything about her, to pass away the time.
2868: 
2869: Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
2870: about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
2871: the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to
2872: herself, “because of his great wig.”
2873: 
2874: The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
2875: wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
2876: did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
2877: 
2878: “And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”
2879: (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were
2880: animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She
2881: said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
2882: proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
2883: girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”
2884: would have done just as well.
2885: 
2886: The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are
2887: they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything
2888: to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”
2889: 
2890: “They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,
2891: “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”
2892: 
2893: “Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
2894: stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the
2895: court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
2896: to make out who was talking.
2897: 
2898: Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
2899: that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,
2900: and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
2901: “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice
2902: muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.
2903: 
2904: One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
2905: could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
2906: very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
2907: that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
2908: at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
2909: was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
2910: was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
2911: 
2912: “Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.
2913: 
2914: On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
2915: unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—
2916: 
2917: “The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
2918:     All on a summer day:
2919: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
2920:     And took them quite away!”
2921: 
2922: 
2923: “Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.
2924: 
2925: “Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great
2926: deal to come before that!”
2927: 
2928: “Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
2929: three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”
2930: 
2931: The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
2932: and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your
2933: Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished
2934: my tea when I was sent for.”
2935: 
2936: “You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”
2937: 
2938: The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
2939: court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
2940: was,” he said.
2941: 
2942: “Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.
2943: 
2944: “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.
2945: 
2946: “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
2947: wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
2948: reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
2949: 
2950: “Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.
2951: 
2952: “It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.
2953: 
2954: “_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
2955: a memorandum of the fact.
2956: 
2957: “I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none
2958: of my own. I’m a hatter.”
2959: 
2960: Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
2961: who turned pale and fidgeted.
2962: 
2963: “Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll
2964: have you executed on the spot.”
2965: 
2966: This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
2967: from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
2968: confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
2969: bread-and-butter.
2970: 
2971: Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
2972: her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
2973: grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
2974: the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
2975: as long as there was room for her.
2976: 
2977: “I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting
2978: next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”
2979: 
2980: “I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”
2981: 
2982: “You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.
2983: 
2984: “Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing
2985: too.”
2986: 
2987: “Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in
2988: that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
2989: to the other side of the court.
2990: 
2991: All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
2992: just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
2993: of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”
2994: on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
2995: off.
2996: 
2997: “Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you
2998: executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”
2999: 
3000: “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
3001: “—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
3002: bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”
3003: 
3004: “The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.
3005: 
3006: “It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.
3007: 
3008: “Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you
3009: take me for a dunce? Go on!”
3010: 
3011: “I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after
3012: that—only the March Hare said—”
3013: 
3014: “I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
3015: 
3016: “You did!” said the Hatter.
3017: 
3018: “I deny it!” said the March Hare.
3019: 
3020: “He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”
3021: 
3022: “Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking
3023: anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
3024: nothing, being fast asleep.
3025: 
3026: “After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”
3027: 
3028: “But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.
3029: 
3030: “That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.
3031: 
3032: “You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”
3033: 
3034: The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
3035: down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.
3036: 
3037: “You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.
3038: 
3039: Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
3040: the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
3041: explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
3042: up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
3043: head first, and then sat upon it.)
3044: 
3045: “I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in
3046: the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at
3047: applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
3048: court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”
3049: 
3050: “If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the
3051: King.
3052: 
3053: “I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”
3054: 
3055: “Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.
3056: 
3057: Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
3058: 
3059: “Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get
3060: on better.”
3061: 
3062: “I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
3063: the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
3064: 
3065: “You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
3066: without even waiting to put his shoes on.
3067: 
3068: “—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the
3069: officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
3070: to the door.
3071: 
3072: “Call the next witness!” said the King.
3073: 
3074: The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
3075: her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
3076: court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
3077: 
3078: “Give your evidence,” said the King.
3079: 
3080: “Shan’t,” said the cook.
3081: 
3082: The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
3083: “Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”
3084: 
3085: “Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
3086: after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
3087: nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”
3088: 
3089: “Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.
3090: 
3091: “Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.
3092: 
3093: “Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!
3094: Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
3095: whiskers!”
3096: 
3097: For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
3098: turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
3099: disappeared.
3100: 
3101: “Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the
3102: next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my
3103: dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
3104: forehead ache!”
3105: 
3106: Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
3107: very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they
3108: haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her
3109: surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
3110: little voice, the name “Alice!”
3111: 
3112: 
3113: 
3114: 
3115: CHAPTER XII.
3116: Alice’s Evidence
3117: 
3118: 
3119: “Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
3120: large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
3121: a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
3122: upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
3123: they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
3124: goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.
3125: 
3126: “Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
3127: began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
3128: of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
3129: idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
3130: jury-box, or they would die.
3131: 
3132: “The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until
3133: all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated
3134: with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.
3135: 
3136: Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
3137: the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
3138: tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
3139: got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she
3140: said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
3141: trial one way up as the other.”
3142: 
3143: As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
3144: upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
3145: them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
3146: accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
3147: anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
3148: court.
3149: 
3150: “What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.
3151: 
3152: “Nothing,” said Alice.
3153: 
3154: “Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.
3155: 
3156: “Nothing whatever,” said Alice.
3157: 
3158: “That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were
3159: just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
3160: Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he
3161: said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
3162: he spoke.
3163: 
3164: “_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on
3165: to himself in an undertone,
3166: 
3167: “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying
3168: which word sounded best.
3169: 
3170: Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”
3171: Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
3172: “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.
3173: 
3174: At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
3175: his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule
3176: Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”
3177: 
3178: Everybody looked at Alice.
3179: 
3180: “_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.
3181: 
3182: “You are,” said the King.
3183: 
3184: “Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.
3185: 
3186: “Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a
3187: regular rule: you invented it just now.”
3188: 
3189: “It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.
3190: 
3191: “Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.
3192: 
3193: The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your
3194: verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
3195: 
3196: “There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the
3197: White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been
3198: picked up.”
3199: 
3200: “What’s in it?” said the Queen.
3201: 
3202: “I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a
3203: letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”
3204: 
3205: “It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to
3206: nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”
3207: 
3208: “Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.
3209: 
3210: “It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s
3211: nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
3212: and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”
3213: 
3214: “Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.
3215: 
3216: “No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest
3217: thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)
3218: 
3219: “He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury
3220: all brightened up again.)
3221: 
3222: “Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they
3223: can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”
3224: 
3225: “If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter
3226: worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed
3227: your name like an honest man.”
3228: 
3229: There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
3230: clever thing the King had said that day.
3231: 
3232: “That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.
3233: 
3234: “It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know
3235: what they’re about!”
3236: 
3237: “Read them,” said the King.
3238: 
3239: The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please
3240: your Majesty?” he asked.
3241: 
3242: “Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you
3243: come to the end: then stop.”
3244: 
3245: These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—
3246: 
3247: “They told me you had been to her,
3248:     And mentioned me to him:
3249: She gave me a good character,
3250:     But said I could not swim.
3251: 
3252: He sent them word I had not gone
3253:     (We know it to be true):
3254: If she should push the matter on,
3255:     What would become of you?
3256: 
3257: I gave her one, they gave him two,
3258:     You gave us three or more;
3259: They all returned from him to you,
3260:     Though they were mine before.
3261: 
3262: If I or she should chance to be
3263:     Involved in this affair,
3264: He trusts to you to set them free,
3265:     Exactly as we were.
3266: 
3267: My notion was that you had been
3268:     (Before she had this fit)
3269: An obstacle that came between
3270:     Him, and ourselves, and it.
3271: 
3272: Don’t let him know she liked them best,
3273:     For this must ever be
3274: A secret, kept from all the rest,
3275:     Between yourself and me.”
3276: 
3277: 
3278: “That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the
3279: King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”
3280: 
3281: “If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so
3282: large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of
3283: interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s
3284: an atom of meaning in it.”
3285: 
3286: The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s
3287: an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the
3288: paper.
3289: 
3290: “If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of
3291: trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t
3292: know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
3293: them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
3294: “—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning
3295: to the Knave.
3296: 
3297: The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he
3298: certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)
3299: 
3300: “All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the
3301: verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of
3302: course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he
3303: did with the tarts, you know—”
3304: 
3305: “But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.
3306: 
3307: “Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
3308: tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
3309: again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I
3310: think?” he said to the Queen.
3311: 
3312: “Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
3313: as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
3314: slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
3315: began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
3316: as it lasted.)
3317: 
3318: “Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the
3319: court with a smile. There was a dead silence.
3320: 
3321: “It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
3322: laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for
3323: about the twentieth time that day.
3324: 
3325: “No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”
3326: 
3327: “Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the
3328: sentence first!”
3329: 
3330: “Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.
3331: 
3332: “I won’t!” said Alice.
3333: 
3334: “Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
3335: moved.
3336: 
3337: “Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
3338: this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”
3339: 
3340: At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
3341: her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
3342: tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
3343: head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
3344: leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
3345: 
3346: “Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve
3347: had!”
3348: 
3349: “Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her
3350: sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
3351: Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
3352: had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious
3353: dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”
3354: So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
3355: what a wonderful dream it had been.
3356: 
3357: 
3358: But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
3359: hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
3360: her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
3361: and this was her dream:—
3362: 
3363: First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
3364: hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
3365: looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
3366: see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
3367: that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or
3368: seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
3369: strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.
3370: 
3371: The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the
3372: frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she
3373: could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
3374: shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
3375: ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby
3376: was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
3377: around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
3378: Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
3379: filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
3380: Turtle.
3381: 
3382: So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
3383: Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
3384: would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the
3385: wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
3386: teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill
3387: cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
3388: shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
3389: (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
3390: lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
3391: Turtle’s heavy sobs.
3392: 
3393: Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
3394: would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
3395: keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
3396: childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
3397: and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
3398: perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
3399: would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
3400: their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
3401: days.

3565:     • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
3566:         the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
3567:         you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

3569:         agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
3570:         Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

3605: effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

3668: Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
3669: 
3670: Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
3671: electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
3672: computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
3673: exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
3674: from people in all walks of life.
3675: 
3676: Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
3677: assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
3678: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
3679: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
3680: Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
3681: and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
3682: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
3683: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
3684: Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
3685:

3689: 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

3691: Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
3692: number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

3700: 
3701: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
3702: Literary Archive Foundation
3703: 
3704: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
3705: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
3706: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
3707: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
3708: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
3709: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
3710: status with the IRS.
3711: 
3712: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
3713: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
3714: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
3715: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
3716: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
3717: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
3718: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
3719: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
3720: 
3721: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
3722: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
3723: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
3724: approach us with offers to donate.
3725: 
3726: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
3727: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
3728: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
3729: 
3730: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
3731: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
3732: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
3733: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
3734: 
3735: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
3736: 
3737: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
3738: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
3739: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
3740: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
3741: volunteer support.
3742: 
3743: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
3744: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
3745: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
3746: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
3747: edition.
3748: 
3749: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
3750: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
3751: 
3752: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
3753: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
3754: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
3755: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
