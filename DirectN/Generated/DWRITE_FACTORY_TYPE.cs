In most cases it is recommended to use the shared factory object, because it allows multiple components that use DirectWrite to share internal DirectWrite state and reduce memory usage. However, there are cases when it is desirable to reduce the impact of a component, such as a plug-in from an untrusted source, on the rest of the process by sandboxing and isolating it from the rest of the process components. In such cases, it is recommended to use an isolated factory for the sandboxed component.
