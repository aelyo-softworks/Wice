Windows Interface Composition Engine ("Wice") is a .NET UI engine for creating Windows application.

Here are the key points for Wice:

* It's available for the .NET Framework 4.7.2 and higher (use the "Wice" project).
* It's available for .NET 5 and higher (use the "WiceCore" project).
* It requires Windows 10 version 1809 ("Redstone 5").
* It's not cross-platform and was never intended to be.
* It's not dependent on WPF nor Winforms, it's another UI Framework. The way it works is somewhat inspired from WPF, but there is no technical dependency over it.
* It's based on Windows UI Composition (aka Direct Composition) DirectX 11 and Direct2D, so it uses composition and doesn't redraw the screen all the time, only when needed.
